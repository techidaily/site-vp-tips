Have you ever felt upset when your device shows full memory status, but you want to shoot more on a long tour? It is a critical situation, and that is why professionals love to take abundant **SD cards** on their journey.

If you are an action camera lover and want to shoot every fantastic part of your tour, then it is advised to speed up your shoots with rich quality SD or Micro SD cards.

No matter whether you are using [Garmin](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Contour, [GoPro](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), or [Sony](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)device, in each case a good memory is essential to capture great footage on the go.

* [Part 1: What to Consider Before Buying a Memory Card for GoPro](#part1)
* [Part 2: Top 5 Best SD Card for GoPro (Hero 8/7 Included)](#part2)

## What to Consider Before Buying a Memory Card for GoPro

#### 1\. Plain SD Card or Micro SD card

You can find various models of Micro SD and simple SD cards in the market, but most of the action cameras need Micro SD cards. The significant difference between both these cards is in their dimensions, as Micro SD cards are much smaller in size.

All latest devices these days are designed with compact size; hence they support micro-sized memory cards for storage of photos and videos.

#### 2\. Speed Class

All SD cards are designed with a special speed class rating that describes their writing data category, and with each type, it represents a real-world recording use for videos.

Out of all varieties available in the market, the most suitable for action cameras are Class 10 (10Mbps), U3 (30Mbps), and U1 (10Mbps). It would help if you went to U3 and U1 because when your camera is C10 but does not support U1 or U3, it will provide lower data writing speed.

If you prefer to work on a 1080p resolution, then Class 10 MicroSD card is best for you. These cards are marked with Full HD capabilities that represent 1080p in this case. GoPro action cameras usually support Class 10 and other superior microSD cards, the lower versions will not work.

#### 3\. SD Card Storage Capacity

The series of GoPro action cameras can handle the certain specific size of microSD cards. The older versions had smaller ratings mostly up to 64GB, whereas the latest devices like Hero4 Silver/Black, Hero5 Session, and Hero5 Black support MicroSD cards up to 128GB.

If you are going to purchase a new MicroSD card for your device, we suggest you check your device specification and pick the card with maximum capacity that your camera can support.

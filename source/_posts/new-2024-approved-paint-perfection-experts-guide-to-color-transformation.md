After that, you can apply a hue and saturation adjustment layer to it to have a white or black effect on the shirt.

The reason for using different adjustment layers is that it can produce natural black or white effects on the shirt flawlessly.

Another technique is to create a “Fill Adjustment Layer” and then change the blending mode into “Multiple.” Now, click on the “Color Picker,” and you can pick and choose your preferred color.

### 6\. Tip 6: Use Blend IF

If you want to change the color of leaves on a tree, you can use the “Blend IF” option of Adobe Photoshop to precisely do the changes. Start with duplicating the existing layer and then hiding the second layer. Double click on the layer to open the menu and then use “Blend IF” sliders. This option works when you drag the sliders to black points, and it automatically hides the dark pixels of your photo.

Similarly, if you drag the “Blend IF” sliders towards white pints, it can hide the light pixels. To hide any specific color from the picture, you can click on “Channels” and then select the color you want to eradicate completely.

![select the channel color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-photo-color-9.jpg)

This method only hides color based on their luminance values; however, this loads the entire layer when loading the active pixels. Regardless, this can be changed into transparency. For this, you need to select the layer by right-clicking and selecting the option of “Convert to Smart Object.”

It helps the user create transparency across the layer. After hiding the layer and coming back to another object-specific layer, you can create a certain change in effect through adjustment layers. For instance, you can create a “Hue and Saturation” adjustment layer. With the above settings, Photoshop applies this as a layer mask for you. Use the sliders across the set layer to change the color across the selected areas.

### 7\. Tip 7: Use Online Photo Editor to Change Colors

If you don’t have an offline tool like Adobe Photoshop, you can use an online photo color editor to replace the colors quickly. In this part, we will suggest [BeFunky](https://www.befunky.com/) photo color editor change the photo colors efficiently.

To change the color, navigate to this tool and upload the images. Then, head to the “Replace Color” option from the left section and click on it. On the menu of “Replace Color,” select the box next to “Source Color” to choose the color you want to replace. Use an eyedropper to select any color for your image.

![select source color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-photo-color-12.jpg)

To increase or decrease the intensity of your color, use the “Tolerance” option, and drag it accordingly. If you want to change the hue of the source color, click on the box next to “Target Color.” If you have accidentally applied any color on some part, you can head to erase tab and can remove the alterations from the brush.

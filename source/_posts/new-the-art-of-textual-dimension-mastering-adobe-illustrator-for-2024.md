## The Art of Textual Dimension: Mastering Adobe Illustrator

It takes 10 minutes. Even if you've never used Adobe Illustrator before, you will still need about 10 minutes to create a 3D text effect in Adobe Illustrator. Whatever your reason for creating this effect, you can customize it thoroughly and get a result that completely meets your requirements.

This guide will show you the step-by-step process of creating a 3D text effect in Adobe Illustrator. So, if you're ready, let's begin.

## What You Need to Create a 3D Text Effect in Adobe Illustrator

All you need are ten minutes of your time and the Adobe Illustrator application. Oh yes, and you need a little bit of imagination as well. That's all there is to it.

After you get the program, install it and follow the step-by-step instructions you'll see below.

Also, there are plenty of different ways to create 3D text effects in Adobe Illustrator. This tutorial will focus on explaining the easiest and quickest one. Just know that this doesn't mean the result will be wrong. Most methods yield the same results.

## How to Create 3D Text Effects in Adobe Illustrator

Now that you know what you're getting into, let's finally reveal the entire process. Just follow the steps and do as you see here.

Step1 Open the program and start a new project.

Step2 Click on the **Type tool** and click anywhere on your blank canvas. Then, type in your text—type in anything you want.

Step5 Align the text to make it easier to edit and move around the canvas later. Just click on it and then click on the three buttons in the image below. This section is located at the bottom-right corner of the screen.

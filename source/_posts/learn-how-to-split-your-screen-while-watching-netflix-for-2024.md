## Learn How To Split Your Screen While Watching Netflix

Video and movie **streaming** has become a common amenity in modern life. Because of **apps**, watching a series or a movie can be done with only a few taps.

Anything is possible with the Netflix **picture-in-picture** feature.

You can comfortably text, mail, or browse the internet while comfortably watching a video on Netflix. Here is the ultimate guide to using the feature across different platforms.

## The Illustrator Way: How to Create Stunning Motion Effects

Vimeo is a popular video streaming platform where you can watch videos all day. Vimeo is a close competitor of YouTube. If you are a regular viewer on Vimeo, you may want to watch a video in a loop. Instead of manually playing the video again and again, you can automatically loop the video on Vimeo.

If you are embedding a Vimeo video on your website, you will want to play it on a loop. This will ensure maximum watch time from the audience. Besides, if you are a video creator, you may want to loop Vimeo videos for your video project. We will illustrate how to loop video on Vimeo for all scenarios.

## Way 1\. Loop A Video on Vimeo Directly

Most online users watch videos on Vimeo directly through the web browser. This is specifically applicable to computer users. If you want Vimeo loop video for any desired video, the steps are simple. You have to make some adjustments and additions to the video URL on the address bar. You should change the URL accurately for looping a video. Here are the steps on how to loop a video on Vimeo directly.

Step 2: Now, you need to change the URL of the video you are playing. Here are the changes to make in the address bar.

* Remove everything at the beginning of "vimeo.com". Add ".player" at the beginning of the URL.
* Add "/video/" after "vimeo.com".
* Add "?amp;loop=1:" at the end of the URL.

Therefore, the initial URL of the video was "<https://vimeo.com/754255543>". You have to change it to "player.vimeo.com/video/754255543?amp;loop=1".

Step 3: After making the changes, press Enter key. The same video will play in a loop until you pause the video or close the web browser's tab.

## Way 2\. Loop a Vimeo Video When Embedded on Your Site

You can embed a Vimeo video on your website so that the audience can watch it. The video will play only once when someone lands on your website. After the video ends playing, the embedding will show suggested videos. If you want the same video to play again and again, you have to put it in a loop. Here are the steps on how to loop Vimeo video when embedded on your website.

Step 1: Open the Vimeo video on your web browser. Click on Share icon present inside the player in the top-right corner.

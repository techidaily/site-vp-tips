Therefore, the majority of users think of Audacity when they wish to record and edit high-quality audio on their PCs. Most people use this open-source audio recorder as their go-to tool because it is totally free to use.

Even if you've never used Audacity before, the procedures we explain here will make it simple for you to record audio of any length.

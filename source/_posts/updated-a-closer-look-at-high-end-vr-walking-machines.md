## Top 5 best VR treadmills you must know

### 1\. [Virtuix Omni](http://www.virtuix.com/)

These are huge treadmills designs. An enormous foundation that retorts to steps. The join allows to duck, though, how relaxed will it feel to be sit in such a “chair,” particularly when playing some games like GTA? It is compatible with Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. For those users who are absolute to pre-order, these products should know that the problem of space is not a problem anymore. But the foundation of the treadmill machine looks too dense, particularly in judgment with Cyberith.

It is rated at $699 for pre-order on the certified website of the product. While engaging an order, one must specify the size of the shoe that arises with the set. And also, there are accessible numerous accessories and plug-in apparatuses for the treadmill machines from $60 to $80.

### 2\. [Cyberith Virtualizer](http://cyberith.com/product/)

It is a lighter and further striking option. The podium here is lesser bulky, and the steps are pursued by the motion sensors. Bowing actions can be achieved more usual due to the opportunity in order to lean on one lap, lacking risk to hurt it. The assembly itself is more moveable, which is the reason it is more attractive, particularly in view of its dimensions. It is also compatible with Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. The lighter structure, and, the very idea of the treadmill guises more auspicious. It is minor, its working technique is based on gliding, not on the crusade of the platform. if the idea of the surface will turn out to be as easy as simple walking, Virtualizer will be the leading product. Furthermore, the device does not need any special shoes, excluding one purchase. There is no official price yet, because of the non-existence of bulk shipment.

### 3\. [KatWalk](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/katvr/kat-walk-a-new-virtual-reality-locomotion-device)

The basis of this product is similar to the Omni, but the key thing is, according to the designers, is the non-existence of the belt or ring around the user’ waist which confines a user from the reality. A superior fascination is located in the higher part of the structure and will defend the user from dwindling. The procedure of walking does not have a gliding effect, the interaction with the surface is automatic, as present in the Omni. For sure the user will need extra shoes that are given in the form of somewhat weighty shoes. Certainly a questionable prototypical, but it got the utmost considerable funding outside Kickstarter amongst all the others products. The price is unknown yet because of no bulk production.

### 4\. [Spacewalker VR](http://spacewalkervr.com/)

Turkish technological corporation SpaceWalkerVR is presently emerging their take on the 360-degree treadmill for VR applications. The hardware structures a spinning treadmill, derived by a gyroscope that wits the user’s actions. Weight sensors beneath the platform notice differences in foot pressure to regulate its power feedback. Apart from its application in the VR, this can also be used as a normal treadmill for aptness training. The SpaceWalkerVR is presently in the prototyping phase and is probable to back the Oculus Rift. Its extra Fantastic Engine provision is predictable to open up SpaceWalkerVR’s apps in virtual gaming surroundings.

### 5\. [Infinadeck](https://www.roadtovr.com/hands-on-with-the-latest-infinadeck-treadmill-at-ces-2016/)

Working on the idea of the old treadmill, Infinadeck is a driven omnidirectional treadmill that has the skill to initiate the player in any course he prefers. Dissimilar to the Virtuix Omni, which is basically a still platform, the Infinadeck actually works by powering a square set of corresponding “mini-treadmills” to exactly put on walking and running actions ranged with any virtual reality concept. It bids the sensation of usual action of jogging, running, or walking in the real life by powering the set of treadmills in any of the direction.

## Why we need VR treadmills and What is it?

You have tried the experience of VR headset and happiness, enjoyment, and bright emotions are what you are certainly going to feel just after 10 minutes of sitting in that chair and relishing some preview provided by the developers. Now, stop your eruption of ecstasy attended by tears of pleasure and then think about a more thoughtful game. An object which is useful in the daily life and for the health purposes as well. Just imagine you are running on the great wall of china, or in the streets of the Antarctica. Isn’t it a great feeling to enjoy such walk. Virtual reality treadmills provide such experiences right in your home. There are two benefits provided by the VR treadmills when you run on this treadmill you feel like running at the most beautiful locations in the world and your health gets better.

## How Do VR treadmills Work?

As a gamer, you would know that safe, and special shoes will offer the most relaxed experience from running around in VR worlds. In addition to this crouch provision (in Virtuix Omni) and get a satisfactorily gorgeous option for shooters and all kinds of "walk emulators." In this racing, and other categories that do not include much walking, the maneuver becomes less valuable: a mixture of "wheel + helmet" is still a more suitable option. Though many will ponder even these benefits a luxury, and some of them just cannot or will not want to kill opponents with a plastic rummage that comes within the set. The camera alignment is immovable for the treadmill and the helmet as well, but there is only one snag. In such games where the user can turn his head discretely from the body the feature will work accordingly, but in the mainstream of up-to-date shooters, it will turn out to be one more “backstab”.

* Using a narrative strategy might make you stand out from the competition since people are attracted to tales.
* Include the most important information at the beginning of your title since lengthier titles are more likely to get chopped off in search page results.
* By being detailed, you provide the reader information they may use to decide if your movie is what they are searching for. By doing this, you could appear higher in search results.
* People also like information that has numbers and lists. Numbers in titles increase the likelihood that they will be clicked on.

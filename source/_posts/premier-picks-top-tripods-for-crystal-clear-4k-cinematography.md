Market is loaded with wide variety of tripod units so most of the buyers feel confusion while investing to buy a new tripod. Tripods play an essential role in digital recording, they helps to keep your footage stable but while buying a Tripod you need to focus upon several specifications.

The article below is designed to provide you all necessary information about Tripods so that you can invest on right product and it can meet your requirements. Keep reading this review of top 8 Tripod units that are compatible with 4K cameras.

## How to Choose Right Tripods for Your 4k Camera?

Before choosing a tripod for your 4K camera, there are some things you need to consider:

#### 1. Weight Capacity

First of all you must think about the weight handling capacity of a tripod. Professionals recommend picking a device with capacity 2 times higher. Note that sometimes you may need to rest your hands on it during long hour shooting so it must be able to handle that additional pressure. You may also need to use a battery grip for your camera at some time during recording applications or may even need to use it with heavier accessories so all these factors must be considered while making a purchase.

#### 2. Tripod Height

A tripod that is equivalent to your height is best because it will not force you to shoot with odd body posture. In case if you are going to buy a tripod that has attached head then this head must reach up to your jaw level for better positioning. One more important thing is to pick a tripod that offers easy portability so that you can carry it to your tours without any disturbance.

#### 3. Tripod Head

A tripod can generally have three types of heads:

* The Pan Tilt head that can possess a single handle to assist in horizontal movements or a dual handle that works for vertical as well as horizontal movements.
* Ball Head have only one type of control that is simple used to make its grip tighter or loser. While keeping the cameras tightly positioned, these heads use to be highly flexible and they ensure smoother operations.
* Gimbal Head is suitable for lenses that have 300mm or higher dimensions. They are highly balanced and allow better results for fast action type photography needs.

#### 4. Tripod Legs

You will find tripods in two different configurations that are tabular and non tabular type. Generally the carbon fiber legs are designed in tabular form; they follow a threaded twist lock type mechanism that makes legs more secure. On other side, steel, basalt and aluminum tripods use to come in various shapes with the flip lock system. With such height variations, you will find at least 3 to 5 tripod leg sections.

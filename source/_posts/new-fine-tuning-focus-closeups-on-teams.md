The goal of this group of technologies is to raise employee productivity.

The user interface can be zoomed in since it is natively supported, however the camera cannot be zoomed in without the use of third-party software.

YouCam Perfect's new image-enhancing features enable you to create magazine-quality portraits from your selfies. The program comes in two versions, one of which is free and the other is a paid version.

YouCam is a program intended to control and use webcams. The webcam or any other camera that is linked to the computer may be accessed by this program, which is highly powerful.

#### 4\.  Flight Performance

This drone is designed with five unique modes for flight; one of these is the journey mode that helps to take of automatically and then starts taking selfie.

Here is good news for professionals; it is possible to connect this drone to more than one controller at a time so that few highly customized shoots can be gathered. Filmmakers love to access these advanced features.

#### 7\.  Camera

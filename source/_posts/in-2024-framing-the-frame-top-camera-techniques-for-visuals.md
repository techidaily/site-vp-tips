## Framing the Frame: Top Camera Techniques for Visuals

Do you want to experience top-tier cinematic effects but are low on budget? Unfortunately, professional high-quality cinematic effects require expensive gadgets that cost a lot of money. Of course, everyone wants to create the best cinematic shots, but spending a lot of money for TikTok or Facebook views is not a good idea.

You can use common household items to uplift the quality of your videos. But how to use these tricks to get great cinematic shots? Don't worry; this article will guide you about using top cinematic/camera tips to boost your video-making experience. We are starting with the smooth camera movement.

## Tip 1\. Smooth Camera Movement

Smooth camera movement is the most basic and vital part of the video-making process. Expensive equipment is used to get smooth camera movements on a professional level.

Still, if you are on a budget, you can use some everyday household objects to get a smooth camera shot. Follow the steps below to get a smooth cinematic video using your phone and duct tape only.

**Steps**

Step 2 Now open and close the door to get smooth camera movement.

## Tip 2\. DIY Light Focus and Control

Shaping light is a crucial component of filmmaking, requiring command over creating and guiding shadows. You need to focus the light on the subjects rather than the background. Use the following methods to focus light on the point of interest.

### DIY LED Panel

You can create LED Panel at home to add light to a subject. Unfortunately, LED strips do not produce bright light when spread as a straight line. However, we can use cardboard and LED light strips to build a broader, more brilliant light. Follow the steps below to make DIY LED Panel.

**Steps**

Step 1 Take a cardboard and an LED strip.

Step 2 Using glue or tape, stick the LED light strip on the cardboard in a spiral shape.

Step 3 Make sure the gap between each spiral is uniform.

Step 4 Plug in the LED strip and use this LED Panel for a broader light source.

Alright! Let's check out how it looks in the video below.

### DIY Light Flag

Black color does not reflect light, so a black fabric can be used to make a DIY Light Flag. Here is a step-by-step guide to creating a light flag at home.

**Steps**

Step 1 Take a black t-shirt and cardboard.

Step 2 Wrap the t-shirt around the cardboard.

Step 3 Use tape to secure the t-shirt so it is firmly attached to cardboard.

Follow the steps to make Light Reflector at almost zero cost.

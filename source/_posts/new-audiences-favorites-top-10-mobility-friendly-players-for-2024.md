Further it will also help you to know about top 10 best portable DVD players that you can pick for your preference list. Keep reading.

## How to Choose Portable DVD Players?

We have gone through these four evaluations while making selection for right portable DVD player:

* **Audio-Video Performance Test:**

If you study specs of DVD players then you will get some idea about their performance but the most trustworthy details can be obtained only after testing audio-video quality on real time basis.

* **Test on Battery Life:**

One of the most important feature of portable DVD players use to be their battery life that can ensure service on the go. Most of the manufacturers promise higher battery power that can serve for two to five hours with ease. Test for battery performance was conducted on maximum brightness level after full charge and then music was played till the time devices shuts down with empty battery.

* **Considerable features for DVD Player selection:**

Most of the people that buy portable DVD players use to install them on back seat of vehicle and often kids on back seat use to enjoy the beats. So it is important to have a remote control for your kid so that he can switch between tracks while sitting there. It should also ensure smooth playback even on bumpy roads. Anti-skipping feature is considered important for a good quality DVD player.

* **Manufacturer’s support to portable DVD players:**

Here is one important fact to consider, as portable DVD players are low cost devices and they are often designed with older technologies so most of the time manufacturers offer limited support to them. At max users will avail maximum warranty of 90 days with their product but in very rare cases it can be up to one year. It is advised to pick device with higher technical support and look for companies that offer live chat, phone contact and email like options for further communication.

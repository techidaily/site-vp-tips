These are basic GoPro Mounts, which can be easily mounted to any curved or flat surface so that your action camera is properly mounted at that spot.

The mounts can be easily detached by applying a heat gun or a hairdryer.

 **Features:**

* The flat and curved adhesive mounts can be attached to any flat or curved surface
* The industrial-strength, waterproof adhesives not just ensures secured mounting but can also be removed by application of heat from a hairdryer or heat gun

#### **2. GoPro Front Facing Mounts**

![GoPro Front Facing Mounts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gopro-front-facing-mount.jpg)

The chin mount is going to give the users the best POV angles they would ever get.

This mount that can be attached to the side of your helmet is a smart option for motorists who don’t wear full-face helmets. While the helmet front mount gives you a centered angle, the side mount would give slightly off-center angles. This official mount is attachable to all GoPro models.

## Optional Mounts

#### Chest Mount Harness

### What is inside the Box?

 You will find so many useful things inside your camera box:

* The beautiful 4K Sony Action Camera
* Adhesive Mount (VCT-AM1)
* (SPK-X1) Waterproof Case that can go underwater up to 33 Feet or 10 meter
* Startup guide for users
* Micro USB Cable
* Rechargeable type battery pack (NP-BX1)

### Design and Accessories

 This device is perfect combination of style, form and features. The thin, long ballet shape looks really impressive and it is much easier to grip even with one hand. The flat base leads to easy stand without any accessory. On bottom side you will find port for external mic input and an advanced tripod mount. Device comes with a waterproof case that allows under water recording up to 33 feet. Its LCD screen is of square shape and two indicated LEDs are attached nearby. The back panel contains slot of battery, MicroSD card, USB and Micro HDMI.

### Highlights

 This device comes with Zeiss Tessar Lens that has 170 degree wide focus and can serve with f/2.8 aperture range. If you turn on the steady shots then its focus goes up to 120 degrees. It captures videos with stunning quality even in low light modes and all the details use to be crisp and clear. One of the most advanced features of this camera unit is its steady shot image stabilization that makes it far better than GoPro Hero. The image stabilization here is digital kind of instead that optical technology and it is not compatible with 4K recording. But when users work with HD then this technique can add much finer results for shooting with rattles and bumps.

### Image Quality and Resolution

 There is no exception to the outstanding still and video quality of Sony FDR-X1000\. You can achieve impressive results with its 4K shooting mode where all details in videos results breathtaking view. For crisp and clear images you can work on 8.8MP still resolution level. Users can even switch to Full HD and 720 p settings with ease where Sony device also leads to top notch content quality. There are two colour modes that make shooting options much useful. You can either switch to Vivid or go for Natural in order to get something unique.

### Wi-Fi and Apps

 You will be glad to know that Sony FDR-X1000 can be accessed from remote location with the help of its dedicated PlayMemories Mobile Application. It assists people to use their smartphone as viewfinder and as a remote unit. Further, it can easily transfer your photos and videos from camera to computer. Here is one more advanced feature, the Highlight Movie Maker; it can allow fast editing over video footage to avail customized results.

### Battery Life and Storage

 The best part to hear about this latest Sony action cam unit is that it comes with a removable battery, so you can enjoy hour long recording by keeping some spare batteries in your bag. The battery life serves excellently for Full HD recording as it can stand up to 2 hours 5 minutes easily. In case of 4K recording that works at 100 Mbps you can use this camera up to 52 minutes without any trouble.

 On the other side if we talk about storage of this device that we must say that it has worked pretty well on enhancement. The MicroSD port is available on backside behind the waterproof door along with a Micro HDMI port so that users can easily transfer their footage to big screen. Note that your Micro SD card must be of at least Class 4 rating if you wish to record MP4 footage. In case of XAVC S recording prefer to use MicroSDXC Class 10 cards or other product that can offer higher speed.

## Recommend best video editing software for action camera users

 If you want to take your video content to the next level with some video editing without being completely overwhelmed, you will definitely want to give Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor) a try. The software offers a free trial period which allows you to try before buy. Well-designed intuitive interface enables anyone to master the program within minutes.

**Conclusion:**

 We can say that Sony has worked well for launching its latest design against GoPro. The finer 4K details and added steadyshot image stabilization feature makes it really useful for athletes and other adventure sports lovers. The one thing where it still needs to improve is the chunky controls and atrocious menus. As GoPro hero is available with the same price tag so these little missing details can force buyers to follow the GoPro series again. There is no doubt to say that GoPro Hero4 Black offers wide range of accessories but after viewing all the updated features of Sony FDR-X1000 we can say that Sony is working in right direction. If you are in favour of flexibility and want to access the GPS tagging feature for your shoots then it is really good to go ahead with FDR-X1000.

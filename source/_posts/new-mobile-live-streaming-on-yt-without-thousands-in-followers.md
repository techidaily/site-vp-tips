## Mobile Live Streaming on YT Without Thousands in Followers

Thanks to the booming Internet technology and the huge Internet user base, live streaming has been rapidly emerging around the world in the past two to three years. And live streaming from mobile is more convenient for anyone than any other device.

## Method 1\. ManyCam

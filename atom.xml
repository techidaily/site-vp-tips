While some models of the para drones can retail for $500-$1000 depending on the accessories you want to use with them, the Parrot AR drone 2.0 Elite Edition is one of the most affordable full-size drones available on the market currently. At a price point of under $300 for the standard version and under $370 for the version with two batteries, The Parrot AR Drone 2.0 Elite Edition sits on the line between a great toy drone and a borderline professional drone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/parrot-ar-drone-elite.jpg"                      alt="parrot ar drone elite"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01JNWLO14/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01JNWLO14&linkId=75a457e4caf0a07b5d6a970a0cc00258" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The parrot AR drone 2.0 is mostly created using plastic as well as a Styrofoam body. The drone can take videos without sound as well as quality still photos. Although it doesn’t have the same type of resilient construction that you can find in many of the world’s top drones today, it also comes in at a price point that’s considerably cheaper.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Complete Review for Parrot Bebop 2 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The Parrot AR drone 2.0 is powered entirely by a Wi-Fi hotspot and in application. It does not come with any kind of control joystick or remote. The drones onboard cameras however do allow you to get a birds eye view of the action as you are flying it. Overall the Parrot AR drone has become a very popular choice for drone pilots as they are starting out the process of filming from a drone.</p><h2 id="Pros-and-cons-of-Parrot-AR-Drone-2-0-Elite-Edition"><a href="#Pros-and-cons-of-Parrot-AR-Drone-2-0-Elite-Edition" class="headerlink" title="Pros and cons of Parrot AR Drone 2.0 Elite Edition"></a>Pros and cons of Parrot AR Drone 2.0 Elite Edition</h2><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>it’s extremely easy to fly as well as great to perform a variety of stunts with</li><li>The controls are quite responsive in the mobile app</li><li>Physical controls require a fairly new smart phone or tablet</li><li>The application only features physical controls with the NVidia shield</li><li>The battery life on the drone is also short</li></ul><p><strong>Verdict</strong></p><p> If you are interested in getting one of the best hobby drones on the market, this is a fun gadget to pick up to learn how to fly a drone. It might it be the newest or most refined product on the market, but it is fairly reliable for a tablet controlled hobby drone.</p><h4 id="1-Features"><a href="#1-Features" class="headerlink" title="1.  Features"></a>1.  Features</h4><p> Some of the main features of this drone include the refined application which is available for iOS and Android smart phones and tablets. This is an application that Parrot uses with many of their drones and they have created separate versions for every major drone they produce. The version of the application for the quad copter is easy to get started with and free to download. As well as offering piloting control is you can record and share videos as well as pictures directly from the application to social media or to other devices within your home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/parrot-ar-free-flight-app.png"                      alt="parrot ar freeflight app"                ></p><p> The drone features a camera for high-definition live video streaming, recording and still photos. The drone also features a live view that can be used with the app for flying the drone. This can help with maneuverability and with learning how to fly the drone.</p><h4 id="2-Design"><a href="#2-Design" class="headerlink" title="2.  Design"></a>2.  Design</h4><p> The main design for this drone is mirroring the look of camouflage. The main component used in the construction of the drone is plastic and Styrofoam. This case an extremely lightweight but the drone also doesn’t come with many of the safeguards in ultrasound sensors that many of the other drones in the professional Parrot line have to offer. As a result, more of the focus is placed on the pilot in actually flying the drone. The good news is that there are a wealth of settings available in the application to help with takeoff and landing. It can take more time to master but with the lightweight construction of the drone, it is very maneuverable.</p><p> The lightweight construction however can run into problems during a crash. This is not a drone that is designed to survive a hard landing or collisions. It also doesn’t fly particularly well in poor weather.</p><h4 id="3-Battery-Life"><a href="#3-Battery-Life" class="headerlink" title="3.  Battery Life"></a>3.  Battery Life</h4><p> The battery life on this drone is considerably shorter than many of the other drones available in its size. The main problem that you can face when piloting this drone is its 5 to 10 min. flight time. If you have settings on the drone to safely land when it reaches near the end of its battery life, you can expect of flight time of just 6 min. on average. This flight time is remedied by purchasing the extended battery from Parrot for an additional $50. This can often extend flight time to at least 10 to 15 min. with a maximum flight time of 18 min..</p><h4 id="4-Performance-in-Flight"><a href="#4-Performance-in-Flight" class="headerlink" title="4.  Performance in Flight"></a>4.  Performance in Flight</h4><p> The takeoff and landing settings can really ease the process of learning how to fly this drone. The app is extremely responsive and the lightweight nature of the drawn makes it very maneuverable while it is in flight. This drone has become a favorite toy in the community to learn how to perform flips and other air trips. With a recommended flight height of within 50 ft this drone can climb fast and perform quite well in fairly calm conditions.</p><h4 id="5-Control-Range"><a href="#5-Control-Range" class="headerlink" title="5.  Control Range"></a>5.  Control Range</h4><p> The control Range on this drone is relatively low as it is operated via Wi-Fi hotspot. In most cases the drone can be controlled within 35 yards but the signal can get week outside of this zone. Making sure to keep the drone relatively close will make sure that safety protocols are not turned on for an automatic landing or so that the drone does not crash.</p><h4 id="6-Camera-quality"><a href="#6-Camera-quality" class="headerlink" title="6.  Camera quality"></a>6.  Camera quality</h4><p> The camera quality on this drone is capable of producing a 720P picture. It doesn’t come with an additional mount so your camera quality is quite restricted. The image quality from the drone is fair but definitely not something that you would want to use for ongoing filming or still capture in the air.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-beginners-guide-to-simple-yet-effective-filming-gear/"><u>[New] In 2024, Beginner's Guide to Simple, Yet Effective Filming Gear</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-spectral-savvy-applying-color-science/"><u>[New] Spectral Savvy  Applying Color Science</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-enhancing-pics-with-sounds-on-websites/"><u>[Updated] Enhancing Pics with Sounds on Websites</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-vlc-player-tips-10-hidden-features/"><u>2024 Approved  VLC Player Tips  10 Hidden Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/vives-discomfort-follow-these-motion-sickness-fixes/"><u>Vive's Discomfort?

For those wanting to learn more about <strong>cloud storage services</strong> read through our extensive list we have reviewed to this point.</p><p>However, if you are just interested in the best providers, we have evaluated them according to various criteria, including capacity, security, and simplicity of use. We have mainly concentrated on providing great paid solutions for individuals and small organizations. So, let us begin our journey to the <strong>best cloud storage for personal use</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/best-cloud-storage-1.jpg"                      alt="beat cloud storage"                ></p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">iCloud (iPhone &amp; Mac)</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">Google Drive</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">The Best Cloud Storage Service for Pictures</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Flickr</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">The Best Cloud Storage Service for Videos</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">Wondershare Drive</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">The Cloud Storage Service with Best Price</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part4-1">IDRIVE</a></li></ol><h2 id="Part-1-The-Overall-Best-Cloud-Storage-Service"><a href="#Part-1-The-Overall-Best-Cloud-Storage-Service" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Overall Best Cloud Storage Service"></a>Part 1: The Overall Best Cloud Storage Service</h2><h3 id="No-1-iCloud-iPhone-Mac"><a href="#No-1-iCloud-iPhone-Mac" class="headerlink" title="No.1 iCloud (iPhone &amp; Mac)"></a>No.1 iCloud (iPhone &amp; Mac)</h3><p>Compared to other <strong>cloud storage services</strong>, Apple’s iCloud operates a little differently because of its effective integration into both macOS and iOS. You can access it through Windows PCs, but honestly, the only scenario in which it makes sense to use it is if you typically work with Apple gear. In addition to the files, images, and videos kept on your iPhone or iPad, iCloud also stores your messages, calendars, contacts, and a variety of other data.</p><p>Once the service is active, you won’t need to make any adjustments since most of what is occurring are behind the scenes, which is one of the benefits of this. In addition, when the time comes for you to upgrade to a new Apple device, you will be able to instantly sync all of the information from your previous device within a few minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/best-cloud-storage-2.jpg"                      alt="icloud"                ></p><p><strong>Reason1: Reasonable price</strong></p><p>Even if the 5 GB of free storage space that comes with iCloud won’t meet your needs, particularly if you want to capture photographs and movies, you can purchase more storage space at more affordable costs. These are as follows: 50 GB for $0.99 (or £0.79 per month), 200 GB for $2.99 (or £2.49 per month), and 2 TB for $9.99 (or $6.99 per month), with the latter two choices, also being eligible for inclusion in Apple’s Family Sharing feature.</p><p><strong>Reason2: Great data security</strong></p><p>You may even collaborate on papers while protecting them with a password. Two-factor authentication is supported. If you sign up for an iCloud+ subscription, Apple will provide you with iCloud Private Relay so that you may browse the internet without worrying about your privacy. Hide My Email; allows you to generate temporary email addresses rather than reveal your own. And HomeKit Secure Video; if you have a HomeKit security camera or video doorbell, these two apps may help you keep your personal information private.</p><p><strong>Reason3: Great connectivity for apple family users.</strong></p><p>It allows for excellent communication with both close friends and relatives. With iOS 16, the iCloud Shared Photo Library is now accessible on iPhones and other Apple products. This function, which allows family members in the library to share images on iCloud as they are taken, may be switched on or off with a flip of the switch inside the camera app.</p><h3 id="No-2-Google-Drive"><a href="#No-2-Google-Drive" class="headerlink" title="No.2 Google Drive"></a>No.2 Google Drive</h3><p>If you already have a Google account, you are automatically entitled to 15 GB of free storage space in Google Drive. You may use this to create backups of important files, such as documents, images, movies, and anything else you want to keep secure.</p><p>The user interface of Drive is uncluttered, straightforward, and only takes about a minute to get used to. It offers helpful capabilities such as sharing URLs to folders (while selecting the amount of control the receiver has), viewing a file even if opened on another device, plus applications for PC, Mac, iOS, and Android. However, this does not mean that Drive <strong>cloud storage</strong> is simple.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/best-cloud-storage-3.jpg"                      alt="google drive"                ></p><p><strong>Reason1: easy to get</strong></p><p>The cloud storage service provided by Google, known as Google Drive, is straightforward to use. Do you own an Android-based device? It is a standard feature. Have you got a Google account? You can get to it using your browser. There are official programs available for both the Mac and iOS platforms, as well as a large number of third-party apps that support Drive. The seamless integration of Drive with the rest of Google’s products is a standout feature. It is possible to create, edit, and share cloud files with others using Google Sheets, Docs, and Slides without ever having to download anything. This feature is limited to previewing Office documents.</p><p><strong>Reason2: free 15GB space</strong></p><p>The free plan offers an industry-leading 15 GB of <strong>cloud storage service</strong>. Users can access even more space via third-party applications (Google Photos specifically stores HD photos, for example). Subscribe to the paid Google One service if you find that 15 GB of storage is insufficient. You can select 100 GB for $1.99 or £1.59&#x2F;month, 200 GB for $2.99 or £2.49 per month, 2 TB for $9.99 or £7.99&#x2F;month, all the way up to 30 TB for a magnificent price of $299.99 or £239.99&#x2F;month (a fraction of what Amazon charges for 30 TB!).</p><p><strong>Reason3: Great Connectivity</strong></p><p>Regarding the fundamentals of <strong>personal cloud storage</strong>, Google Drive delivers features such as simple access to data from applications and your browser, the option to recover older versions of files, and offline access when not connected to the Internet. But there is some bad news as well. The syncing process is not as straightforward as it is with some of the company’s rivals, and there is no end-to-end encryption. This means that Google could, in principle, see your data.</p><h2 id="Part-2-The-Best-Cloud-Storage-Service-for-Pictures"><a href="#Part-2-The-Best-Cloud-Storage-Service-for-Pictures" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The Best Cloud Storage Service for Pictures"></a>Part 2: The Best Cloud Storage Service for Pictures</h2><p>Saving your best images and shots is a must. After all, you never know when you will need that school get-together pictures for an event.</p><p>Thus, here is the <strong>best cloud storage for personal use</strong>.</p><h3 id="Flickr"><a href="#Flickr" class="headerlink" title="Flickr"></a>Flickr</h3><p>Flickr <strong>cloud storage</strong> has been around for a long time and was once considered one of the most outstanding internet services for uploading images and videos. Several companies have owned it, and SmugMug has been the current owner s ince April 20, 2018. You don’t need to sign up to see images and videos on Flickr, but if you want to post anything to the website, you will need to sign up for an account first. A user may add another Flickr user as a contact after making an account with the website. This allows the user to construct a profile page that displays photographs and videos that the user has posted to the website. Flickr provides mobile users with official mobile applications for iOS and Android, in addition to a mobile site optimized for usage on mobile devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/best-cloud-storage-4.jpg"                      alt="flickr"                ></p><p><strong>Free 1000-picture storage</strong></p><p>Free <strong>cloud storage services</strong> for up to 1000 images and videos are available via Flickr. However, the restriction depends on the number of photographs rather than the storage size. You may upload your pictures in total, uncompressed splendor without worrying about conserving space.</p><p><strong>Unlimited storage for premium users.</strong></p><p>If you think that 1,000 images won’t be enough, you have the option to subscribe for simply $7.99 more each month. It is worth considering that it already provides unlimited storage and removes all advertisements from your experience. You will not need to update your system a second time to get an additional terabyte of storage space.</p><p><strong>Other features.</strong></p><p>Flickr provides a sharing link for images and albums and the ability to manage the groups of people who may see your photos. Additionally, Flickr allows other users who have access to your photos to comment on them, “star” them and follow you to get updates on your photo uploads. You can get more out of your Flickr account by connecting it to third-party applications and sharing your photographs on social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Tumbler. You can examine how many views your images have received and determine their credit rights.</p><h2 id="Part-3-The-Best-Cloud-Storage-Service-for-Videos"><a href="#Part-3-The-Best-Cloud-Storage-Service-for-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: The Best Cloud Storage Service for Videos"></a>Part 3: The Best Cloud Storage Service for Videos</h2><h3 id="Wondershare-Drive"><a href="#Wondershare-Drive" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Drive"></a>Wondershare Drive</h3><p>The Wondershare Drive is the <strong>best cloud storage</strong> platform that caters to those who create both work and content. You can save images, movies, files, and other stuff in a secure manner, as well as share it without being limited by the device. An essential feature is that you can upload the project you are working on in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the Wondershare Drive. This will allow you to edit films regardless of where you are. You may manage files stored in Wondershare Drive in Filmora or by going to <a class="link"   href="https://drive-web.wondershare.com/" >https://drive-web.wondershare.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>You also can upload files using this page. In addition, you can do fundamental administration tasks inside the drive, such as relocating, renaming, erasing, and downloading data. Even you can highlight the crucial files.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/best-cloud-storage-5.jpg"                      alt="wondershare drive"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-The-Cloud-Storage-Service-with-Best-Price"><a href="#Part-4-The-Cloud-Storage-Service-with-Best-Price" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: The Cloud Storage Service with Best Price"></a>Part 4: The Cloud Storage Service with Best Price</h2><h3 id="IDRIVE"><a href="#IDRIVE" class="headerlink" title="IDRIVE"></a>IDRIVE</h3><p>Have a lot of expensive documents to safeguard?</p><p>IDrive comes out on top as the most acceptable <strong>cloud storage</strong> option because of its superb backup features, user-friendly applications, high level of data protection, and competitive pricing. There are notable characteristics for every user, like:</p><p>You are free to install IDrive on as many different devices as you choose. Plus, if you make changes to a file on one of your devices and then sync it to the others, the changes will take effect immediately.</p><p>In addition, extensive backup options make it possible to save anything from individual files and folders to create a whole image of your device, facilitating straightforward recovery in the event of a catastrophe. (If you have a terrible internet connection and the file will take a long time to download, IDrive can even give you a physical drive with all your data, which is a huge advantage.)</p><p>Two-factor authentication safeguards your account no matter what you’re up to, and end-to-end encryption makes it impossible for anybody to acquire even a whiff of the information you’ve stored there.</p><p>However, if you are not the technical type, don’t worry. You can set up IDrive in a matter of moments and forget it’s there, allowing the service to do its job. Highly configurable apps enable tweaking all low-level settings (bandwidth throttling, data verification), but if you aren’t the technical type, that’s okay too.</p><p>What’s more? Well, check out the fantastic new offer.</p><p>Get up to 90% off on 10 terabytes of storage space based on your region. You can also use the company’s free lifetime plan with 10 GB of storage space. This plan is ideal for testing the service and determining whether or not it will meet your needs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/best-cloud-storage-6.jpg"                      alt="idrive"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Do you wish to make a backup of your most cherished memories on the cloud?

And HomeKit Secure Video; if you have a HomeKit security camera or video doorbell, these two apps may help you keep your personal information private.</p><p><strong>Reason3: Great connectivity for apple family users.</strong></p><p>It allows for excellent communication with both close friends and relatives. With iOS 16, the iCloud Shared Photo Library is now accessible on iPhones and other Apple products. This function, which allows family members in the library to share images on iCloud as they are taken, may be switched on or off with a flip of the switch inside the camera app.</p><h3 id="No-2-Google-Drive-1"><a href="#No-2-Google-Drive-1" class="headerlink" title="No.2 Google Drive"></a>No.2 Google Drive</h3><p>If you already have a Google account, you are automatically entitled to 15 GB of free storage space in Google Drive. You may use this to create backups of important files, such as documents, images, movies, and anything else you want to keep secure.</p><p>The user interface of Drive is uncluttered, straightforward, and only takes about a minute to get used to. It offers helpful capabilities such as sharing URLs to folders (while selecting the amount of control the receiver has), viewing a file even if opened on another device, plus applications for PC, Mac, iOS, and Android. However, this does not mean that Drive <strong>cloud storage</strong> is simple.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/best-cloud-storage-3.jpg"                      alt="google drive"                ></p><p><strong>Reason1: easy to get</strong></p><p>The cloud storage service provided by Google, known as Google Drive, is straightforward to use. Do you own an Android-based device? It is a standard feature. Have you got a Google account? You can get to it using your browser. There are official programs available for both the Mac and iOS platforms, as well as a large number of third-party apps that support Drive. The seamless integration of Drive with the rest of Google’s products is a standout feature. It is possible to create, edit, and share cloud files with others using Google Sheets, Docs, and Slides without ever having to download anything. This feature is limited to previewing Office documents.</p><p><strong>Reason2: free 15GB space</strong></p><p>The free plan offers an industry-leading 15 GB of <strong>cloud storage service</strong>. Users can access even more space via third-party applications (Google Photos specifically stores HD photos, for example). Subscribe to the paid Google One service if you find that 15 GB of storage is insufficient. You can select 100 GB for $1.99 or £1.59&#x2F;month, 200 GB for $2.99 or £2.49 per month, 2 TB for $9.99 or £7.99&#x2F;month, all the way up to 30 TB for a magnificent price of $299.99 or £239.99&#x2F;month (a fraction of what Amazon charges for 30 TB!).</p><p><strong>Reason3: Great Connectivity</strong></p><p>Regarding the fundamentals of <strong>personal cloud storage</strong>, Google Drive delivers features such as simple access to data from applications and your browser, the option to recover older versions of files, and offline access when not connected to the Internet. But there is some bad news as well. The syncing process is not as straightforward as it is with some of the company’s rivals, and there is no end-to-end encryption. This means that Google could, in principle, see your data.</p><h2 id="Part-2-The-Best-Cloud-Storage-Service-for-Pictures-1"><a href="#Part-2-The-Best-Cloud-Storage-Service-for-Pictures-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The Best Cloud Storage Service for Pictures"></a>Part 2: The Best Cloud Storage Service for Pictures</h2><p>Saving your best images and shots is a must.

Several companies have owned it, and SmugMug has been the current owner s ince April 20, 2018. You don’t need to sign up to see images and videos on Flickr, but if you want to post anything to the website, you will need to sign up for an account first. A user may add another Flickr user as a contact after making an account with the website. This allows the user to construct a profile page that displays photographs and videos that the user has posted to the website. Flickr provides mobile users with official mobile applications for iOS and Android, in addition to a mobile site optimized for usage on mobile devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/best-cloud-storage-4.jpg"                      alt="flickr"                ></p><p><strong>Free 1000-picture storage</strong></p><p>Free <strong>cloud storage services</strong> for up to 1000 images and videos are available via Flickr. However, the restriction depends on the number of photographs rather than the storage size. You may upload your pictures in total, uncompressed splendor without worrying about conserving space.</p><p><strong>Unlimited storage for premium users.</strong></p><p>If you think that 1,000 images won’t be enough, you have the option to subscribe for simply $7.99 more each month. It is worth considering that it already provides unlimited storage and removes all advertisements from your experience. You will not need to update your system a second time to get an additional terabyte of storage space.</p><p><strong>Other features.</strong></p><p>Flickr provides a sharing link for images and albums and the ability to manage the groups of people who may see your photos. Additionally, Flickr allows other users who have access to your photos to comment on them, “star” them and follow you to get updates on your photo uploads. You can get more out of your Flickr account by connecting it to third-party applications and sharing your photographs on social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Tumbler. You can examine how many views your images have received and determine their credit rights.</p><h2 id="Part-3-The-Best-Cloud-Storage-Service-for-Videos-1"><a href="#Part-3-The-Best-Cloud-Storage-Service-for-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: The Best Cloud Storage Service for Videos"></a>Part 3: The Best Cloud Storage Service for Videos</h2><h3 id="Wondershare-Drive-1"><a href="#Wondershare-Drive-1" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Drive"></a>Wondershare Drive</h3><p>The Wondershare Drive is the <strong>best cloud storage</strong> platform that caters to those who create both work and content.

Plus, if you make changes to a file on one of your devices and then sync it to the others, the changes will take effect immediately.</p><p>In addition, extensive backup options make it possible to save anything from individual files and folders to create a whole image of your device, facilitating straightforward recovery in the event of a catastrophe. (If you have a terrible internet connection and the file will take a long time to download, IDrive can even give you a physical drive with all your data, which is a huge advantage.)</p><p>Two-factor authentication safeguards your account no matter what you’re up to, and end-to-end encryption makes it impossible for anybody to acquire even a whiff of the information you’ve stored there.</p><p>However, if you are not the technical type, don’t worry. You can set up IDrive in a matter of moments and forget it’s there, allowing the service to do its job. Highly configurable apps enable tweaking all low-level settings (bandwidth throttling, data verification), but if you aren’t the technical type, that’s okay too.</p><p>What’s more? Well, check out the fantastic new offer.</p><p>Get up to 90% off on 10 terabytes of storage space based on your region. You can also use the company’s free lifetime plan with 10 GB of storage space.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Decoding-Your-Home-Theater-Setup-Projection-or-Television-for-4K"><a href="#Decoding-Your-Home-Theater-Setup-Projection-or-Television-for-4K" class="headerlink" title="Decoding Your Home Theater Setup: Projection or Television for 4K?"></a>Decoding Your Home Theater Setup: Projection or Television for 4K?</h2><h1 id="Projector-vs-TV-Which-is-best-for-your-4K-experience"><a href="#Projector-vs-TV-Which-is-best-for-your-4K-experience" class="headerlink" title="Projector vs TV: Which is best for your 4K experience"></a>Projector vs TV: Which is best for your 4K experience</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Max-Wales"><a href="#Max-Wales" class="headerlink" title="Max Wales"></a>Max Wales</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> In its relatively short history, 4K home theater projectors and 4K TVs have significantly changed the world of home entertainment. The quality and size of the pictures today are better than ever before, and the possibility to enjoy near perfect image quality from the comfort of your own home has never been more accessible to the mainstream audience. Still, there is one important question that remains unanswered. Does a projector provide a better 4K experience than the 4K TV? Most people who face the projector VS TV dilemma are just looking for the best home entertainment experience, so here are some information that can help you make your own choice.</p><h2 id="4K-Projectors-Vs-4K-TVs"><a href="#4K-Projectors-Vs-4K-TVs" class="headerlink" title="4K Projectors Vs 4K TVs"></a>4K Projectors Vs 4K TVs</h2><h4 id="1-Resolution"><a href="#1-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="1.  Resolution"></a>1.  Resolution</h4><p> When you are buying a 4K TV there is very little doubt whether or not it is indeed a 4K TV. If the screen resolution is 3840 X 2160 then you are looking at the 4K Ultra HD TV, anything short of that is no longer a 4K TV. With TVs that have a resolution as high as this, you can be sure that all 4K or HDR content is designed to fit perfectly on its screen, while things are a little bit different with 4K projectors.</p><p> Many of the 4K projectors are not exactly that because they offer a pseudo 4K resolution through pixel interpolation. To make things even worse, most of the projectors offer only the ability to read and display 4K content, through native Full HD image sensor. If you are not looking to buy a high-end 4K projector make sure that the item you wish to purchase has a true 4K capability.</p><h4 id="2-Brightness-and-Contrast"><a href="#2-Brightness-and-Contrast" class="headerlink" title="2.  Brightness and Contrast"></a>2.  Brightness and Contrast</h4><p> If you ever watched a movie in a cinema you know that projectors need dark rooms to deliver their best performance. The image brightness, 4K projectors designed for home entertainment, can deliver is largely dependent on the light conditions of the room. But even in the perfect conditions of a darkened room, most projectors can’t generate the same level of the projection brightness as a 4K TV.</p><p> On the other hand, most projectors have overall better contrast ratios than the one generated on the screen of a 4K HDR TV, with the exception of TVs that feature OLED technology.</p><h4 id="3-Colors"><a href="#3-Colors" class="headerlink" title="3.  Colors"></a>3.  Colors</h4><p> Projector vs 4K TV dilemma becomes slightly more complicated when it comes to colors since both 4K TVs and 4K HDR projectors deliver stunningly vibrant colors. In addition, both of these device types are capable of displaying 90% of the HDR color space and cover more than 1.07 billion color shades.</p><p> Even though the colors look more vivid on 4K TVs solely because of its huge brightness advantage over the projectors, 4K HDR projectors still offer a somewhat wider color space and coverage.</p><h4 id="4-Picture-Display"><a href="#4-Picture-Display" class="headerlink" title="4.  Picture Display"></a>4.  Picture Display</h4><p> There is no question that projectors have a clear advantage over TVs when it comes to picture display. You can adjust the size of the picture by changing the projector’s distance from the surface you want to project the pictures to and you can choose on which surface you want to project pictures. Projection screens usually do the trick, although there might be some research involved related to the room characteristics since you need to know the dimensions of the wall and the room size so you can place the projector at the optimum distance from the screen.</p><p> With 4K TVs, you may not get a huge picture display, but the conditions you have to meet in order to enjoy 4K images are much simpler.</p><h4 id="5-Audio"><a href="#5-Audio" class="headerlink" title="5.  Audio"></a>5.  Audio</h4><p> All 4K TVs have their own speakers that are more than enough to enjoy the 4K footage you want to watch on your TV. Some models of 4K projectors can have speakers, but because of the position of the projector, they are often behind and above you which doesn’t bode well for the audio performance. Most 4K projectors require a setup that includes several external speakers to enable an enjoyable viewing experience.</p><p> Furthermore, 4K TV’s are much easier to connect with audio devices and you can control the setup with the TV’s remote which makes your home entertainment experience much more comfortable.</p><h4 id="6-Installation"><a href="#6-Installation" class="headerlink" title="6.  Installation"></a>6.  Installation</h4><p> Setting up a 4K TV is very simple. All you need to do is to find an elevated flat surface on which you wish to place the TV, plug it into the nearest electrical socket and turn it on. If you wish to connect your TV to your desktop computer or your stereo system you might need to get a few more cables, but that is where your troubles end.</p><p> Unfortunately the same cannot be said for 4K projectors because you first need to find the right distance from the projection screen, then you must connect it to a computer or video playback device and finally you need to adjust picture sharpness that is directly related to the distance from the projection screen. In terms of simplicity and the amount of time needed for installation the projector VS 4K TV, dilemma seems to be non-existent</p><h4 id="7-Viewing-experience"><a href="#7-Viewing-experience" class="headerlink" title="7.  Viewing experience"></a>7.  Viewing experience</h4><p> For some people, at least the experience of having a 4K projector in your home may be reminiscent of watching a movie in the theater. Also, the projected images might be lighter on the eyes, but if you are thinking about getting a 4K projector bear in mind that you’ll need additional equipment to have the best possible viewing experience.</p><p> 4K TV’s provide less immersive experience than the 4K projectors, however, with so many models available with the size of more than 60 inches that provide crisp and vivid colors the experience of watching a movie or any other 4K content is nothing short of superb.</p><h4 id="8-Cost"><a href="#8-Cost" class="headerlink" title="8.  Cost"></a>8.  Cost</h4><p> 4K projectors vs 4K TVs comparison is not hard to make when it comes to price because projectors are much more expensive. Even the Full HD, 2K projectors that can play 4K content cost between $3.000 and 5.000$, while home entertainment projectors with native 4K resolution don’t cost less than $10.000.</p><p> 4K TVs are much more affordable since you can purchase a new 60-inch model for approximately $2.000. The image quality of 4K projectors simply doesn’t justify their price.</p><h2 id="Winner-4K-TV"><a href="#Winner-4K-TV" class="headerlink" title="Winner - 4K TV"></a>Winner - 4K TV</h2><p> The high price, relatively complicated setup, additional equipment that is required for a perfect home entertainment experience make the 4K projection VS 4K TV showdown incredibly unfair because 4K TVs are simply better in each and every of these aspects. Perhaps the best option is to have both a projector and a 4K TV, but if your budget is limited and you can’t spare $3000 or much more for a 4K projector, we suggest that TV is much better option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-celebrating-the-greats-anime-opens-of-all-time/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Celebrating the Greats  Anime Opens of All Time</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-sound-windows-10-recorder-tips/"><u>In 2024, Mastering Sound  Windows 10 Recorder Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-metaverse-joke-ology-building-your-own-hilarious-memes/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Metaverse Joke-Ology  Building Your Own Hilarious Memes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-introduction-to-moving-graphics-core-principles/"><u>[New] In 2024, Introduction to Moving Graphics  Core Principles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-dive-deep-into-video-a-compreenas-guide-to-sharing-pictures-online/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Dive Deep Into Video  A Compreenas Guide to Sharing Pictures Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-the-photographers-route-to-perfectly-trimmed-web-pics/"><u>[New] The Photographer's Route to Perfectly Trimmed Web Pics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/film-lovers-ultimate-selection-of-stop-motion-works-for-2024/"><u>Film Lovers' Ultimate Selection of Stop-Motion Works for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-sustainable-design-in-action-the-huawei-p10s-environmental-approach/"><u>2024 Approved  Sustainable Design in Action  The Huawei P10’s Environmental Approach</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-top-10-camcorders-ultimate-picks-expert-reviews/"><u>[New] Top 10 Camcorders  Ultimate Picks – Expert Reviews</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-organizing-virtual-gatherings-syncing-slack-with-filmoras-features/"><u>In 2024, Organizing Virtual Gatherings  Syncing Slack with Filmora's Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-check-distance-and-radius-on-google-maps-for-your-apple-iphone-6-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Check Distance and Radius on Google Maps For your Apple iPhone 6 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-channel-image-makeovers-on-the-house-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Channel Image Makeovers on the House for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-get-the-rare-candy-on-pokemon-go-fire-red-on-huawei-nova-y71-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Get the Rare Candy on Pokemon Go Fire Red On Huawei Nova Y71 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/things-you-dont-know-about-honor-x50-gt-reset-code-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>Things You Dont Know About Honor X50 GT Reset Code | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/2024-approved-2023s-best-free-dvd-players-for-windowsmac-pcs/"><u>2024 Approved  2023'S Best Free DVD Players for Windows/Mac PCs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/top-iphone-lens-enhancers-x8-series-selection-for-2024/"><u>Top iPhone Lens Enhancers  X/8 Series Selection for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-or-bypass-knox-enrollment-service-on-oppo-a18-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Remove or Bypass Knox Enrollment Service On Oppo A18</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-how-to-convert-time-lapse-to-normal-video/"><u>Updated In 2024, How to Convert Time-Lapse to Normal Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/the-best-11-first-timer-kids-cameras-for-rainy-day-vlogging/"><u>The Best 11 First-Timer Kids' Cameras for Rainy Day Vlogging</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

But now many companies are working hard for proving themselves against GoPro series and Sony is on the top in this list. As it has worked so far on movie production and camera development so it is right time to include Sony product in comparative conversation.</p><p> If we talk about the features then both these cameras can work fine with smart phones and they support ultra high definition type recording with impressive results. If you are a scuba diver then both cameras will fulfil your needs with their waterproof housing arrangement. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Sony FDR-X1000V <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is holding the price tag of $599 whereas the competing model <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >GoPro hero4 black <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is being sold at $353.

You need not to apply any additional protective arrangement to your Sony action camera yet it will serve with splash resistant capabilities. Go Pro hero4 Black is a tiny device with dimensions 41x59x30mm when here is no housing attached.</li><li><strong>Display (Screen):</strong><br> GoPro Hero4 Black comes with 2 inch touch screen type display that assists users in easy preview. One can playback his shots, trim recorded footage and also adjust basic settings from this display. SONY FDR X1000V possesses built in LCD display that provides 2.8 times better results as compared to its predecessors.</li><li><strong>Interface:</strong><br> The Sony device includes so many control options with its menus and extended sub menus. They can help you to navigate through various tasks such as switching to Wi-Fi connectivity. You will find 12 buttons on its hardware that can be used for various settings. On the other side the GoPro interface is rated as simpler and intuitive with 11 buttons.<br><strong>Performance:</strong></li></ol><p> If we track the specifications of both these devices then definitely GoPro Hero4 wins with its feature rich design. GoPro can capture breath-taking stills with its 12MP resolution whereas Sony device is limited to 8.8MP capabilities. The Field of View offered by both devices is 120 degrees but in case of Sony photos can be captured at 170 degree focus. In both these cameras you can preview your captured photographs side by side.</p><p> When stills are captured in normal light conditions using GoPro device they result in sharper colour information with perfect adjustments of reds and greens. The GoPro colour settings can be enabled or disabled by user as per need. But in case of Sony FDR you will find more influence of blue in stills. This feature make it suitable action camera for snowboarders and surfers as they can capture the colour of sky or ocean with much better clarity. The low light details are finer in case of GoPro with sharp resolution.</p><p> Time-lapse video mode is supported by both cameras but Sony device limits its capabilities to 1080p resolution level whereas you can achieve 4K shooting with GoPro Hero4 Black. Sony also demands little efforts for generation of time lapse videos after footage generation but in case of GoPro you will get ready to upload file at the end. You will avail impressive results with both cameras even in adverse weather conditions and footage will not appear shaky. Audio track was observed to provide better results in case of GoPro where noise attenuation is much finer.</p><p><strong>Waterproof:</strong></p><p> Although Sony FDR is a waterproof device without housing but it can go under water only up to 32 feet whereas Hero4 is a dive special unit that can reach up to 131 feet. Sony is no doubt bulkier as compared to its competitor with its splash resistant body but at the same time features are approaching to serve best.</p><p><strong>Battery and Memory:</strong></p><p> Sony X1000 action camera provides outstanding battery life with its 1240 mAh module but on the other side GoPro comes with 1160mAh battery capability. FDR has rechargeable battery and it can serve up to 3 hours 17 minutes when user is working with 1080p resolution but prefer to keep Wi-Fi off. Hero4 can work tirelessly up to 1.54 hours with series of photos. Prefer to use MicroSDXC card for better storage results with Sony device whereas Hero4 Black works fine with Class 10 cards.</p><p><strong>Wi-Fi and Apps:</strong></p><p> Both action cameras are Wi-Fi enabled so you can have remote control on your footage but if we talk about GPS then this feature is missing in GoPro Hero4 Black. Although there are 12 buttons on Sony and 11 on GoPro body but Wi-Fi enabled applications assists in easy navigation.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p> Those who are in search of impressive image quality can go ahead with Sony FDRX1000V but for under water needs GoPro device is proven to be better. The footage sharpness is higher in GoPro with its higher frame rate settings and stills here appear much vibrant. You will definitely find so many advantages of GoPro that is why it is a leader in action camera market but at the same time Sony has its own strengths even with and offering that is $140 cheaper and still has longer battery life as well as GPS capability.</p><p> Selection for right device completely depends upon your requirements as both these units have excellence in unique features. It is advised to rate features as per your need and then pick your device from market to avail maximum benefits. On price point of view, definitely you should go for Sony FDR X1000V.</p><p><strong>Recommend best video editing software for action camera users</strong></p><p> If you want to take your video content to the next level with some video editing without being completely overwhelmed, you will definitely want to give <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (originally Wondershare Video Editor) a try.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Cutting-Edge-Components-in-Desktops"><a href="#Cutting-Edge-Components-in-Desktops" class="headerlink" title="Cutting-Edge Components in Desktops"></a>Cutting-Edge Components in Desktops</h2><p>The designs of swanky, cutting-edge laptops are always changing. Smartphones are incredibly versatile and</p><p>widely used. Where does that leave the desktop PC, a relic of the 1980s? There are still a ton of options</p><p>available, and the desktop market is constantly innovating, particularly regarding all-in-one and small-</p><p>form-factor devices. But many customers appear to view desktop computers as an antique, since they</p><p>immediately walk to the laptop aisle when making their next computer purchase.</p><p>Let’s start off!</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">MSI MEG Aegis Ti5</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Corsair One i300</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">Mac Mini (M1, 2020)</a></li><li><a href="#part2-4">Lenovo Yoga A940</a></li><li><a href="#part2-5">Azulle Access4</a></li><li><a href="#part2-6">Alienware Aurora R13</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">How much CPU power do you need</a></li><li><a href="#part4">What graphics card do you need</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-much-does-a-desktop-cost"><a href="#Part-1-How-much-does-a-desktop-cost" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How much does a desktop cost?"></a>Part 1. How much does a desktop cost?</h2><p>The value the desktop offers are among its most attractive claims. With desktop PCs and their components,</p><p>your money just goes further. Instead of spending $600 on a laptop with a capable Intel Core i5 processor, you could spend the same amount of money on a desktop with a Core i7 CPU and perhaps even room for a</p><p>dedicated graphics card.</p><p>For very light labor and display-signage activities, entire micro-PCs are available for about $300, while perfectly functional small towers are available for between $300 and $600. Starting at about $600, gaming desktops with discrete graphics cards are available. All-in-one desktops, which include the display and all of the computer hardware in a single unit, are also available and start at about $450.</p><p>With desktops, you don’t run some of the same risks that you would with a laptop of comparable price. For</p><p>basic computing, a $250 Black Friday deal or a heavily discounted used desktop could work just fine, and you</p><p>wouldn’t have to worry about the cheap materials wearing out the way you could with a laptop of a comparable price. The whims of daily commuting and the sporadic drop from a coffee table would befall that</p><p>cheap laptop. However, the desktop would have to remain stationary and continue to function.</p><p>Business workstations, blinged-out gaming rigs, and exquisitely constructed all-in-one PCs that cost several</p><p>thousand dollars are available at the top of the market. A $3,000 gaming tower will not only provide enormous</p><p>computational capability for today, but it should also have so much room for growth and upgradeability that it will have a considerably longer useful life than any laptop. And that’s before you even explore the wacky world of custom PCs, which includes paint jobs that rival those on automobiles, liquid cooling, and extravagant</p><p>lighting and wiring.</p><p>Business PCs that are IT-manageable and security-conscious—the majority of which are now produced by Dell, HP, and Lenovo—have their own price dynamics and generally cost more. This is due to their expensive</p><p>warranty or maintenance packages as well as the potential addition of enterprise-specific silicon with a</p><p>manageability or security focus. Sometimes, a portion of the price premium for business desktops reflects the</p><p>PC manufacturer’s promise to keep extra parts and upgrades in stock for that model of computers for a specific amount of time in the future. As a result, IT professionals may rely on being able to maintain a fleet of a specific business machine for that period.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-desktops-are-recommended"><a href="#Part-2-What-desktops-are-recommended" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What desktops are recommended?"></a>Part 2. What desktops are recommended?</h2><p>Choosing a new PC tower might be challenging, but we’ve outlined the top models for each function, from</p><p>gaming powerhouses to small PCs for your home office. You may use this list to locate the finest PC to meet</p><p>your demands, whether you’re a student, a busy professional, or an avid gamer.</p><h3 id="1-MSI-MEG-Aegis-Ti5"><a href="#1-MSI-MEG-Aegis-Ti5" class="headerlink" title="1.

That, in our opinion, is the MSI MEG Aegis Ti5: a jaw-droppingly distinctive gaming PC with an almost absurdly powerful hardware setup. The front of the computer features a “Gamer Dial” that can be used to adjust system performance settings and display data or amusing animations on a tiny circular</p><p>display.</p><p>The MEG Aegis Ti5 is available in several versions, all of which have the newest gaming hardware. The</p><p>most recent top-spec setup uses an Nvidia RTX 3090 graphics card and an ultra-modern Intel Core i9-12900K</p><p>CPU, but there are many other variants available if that isn’t precisely what you’re looking for.

How much CPU power do you need?"></a>Part 3. How much CPU power do you need?</h2><p>A desktop tower’s utilization of a desktop-grade CPU is one of its key advantages. It may seem simple, but that is a crucial distinction.</p><p>The two largest PC processor manufacturers, AMD and Intel, provide desktop-class chips and laptop-class chips to system builders, although frequently the CPU model names are identical and difficult to distinguish. For instance, you can find Intel’s Core i7 in both laptops and desktops, but a “real” desktop CPU as opposed to one designed for a mobile device performs far better.</p><p>For challenging content creation tasks, PC gaming, or math and science projects, a desktop CPU gives you</p><p>additional power. Software developed to take advantage of the extra cores will profit from faster processors</p><p>with four, six, eight, or perhaps as many as 18 cores. In comparison to variants created for laptops, which must</p><p>be integrated into surroundings with less thermal and power-delivery leeway, the desktop version of a given</p><p>CPU will use more energy and produce more heat. The ability to multithread, which enables each of the CPU’s</p><p>cores to address two processing threads simultaneously rather of just one, is another important feature that</p><p>can be more easily included into a desktop CPU. When used with appropriate software, multithreading,</p><p>sometimes known as “Hyper-Threading” by Intel, can significantly improve performance.</p><p>High-end towers with enough of interior room are the only ones that can accommodate liquid cooling systems, which are only necessary for the very highest-end desktop CPUs. These are very specialized and expensive processors, so you should only use them if you have extremely particular software requirements that you are certain can take use of their higher base and peak clock rates as well as all of their addressable cores and threads. These are not only random purchases.</p><p>Contrarily, many AIOs and tiny PCs employ the same effective, cooler-running CPU designs as you may find in laptops. While most desktop chips have a “T” or “K” or simply a zero at the end, Intel often marks their mobile- first chip designs with a CPU name that contains “U,” “H,” or “P.” Despite having the same number of</p><p>processing cores as its desktop equivalent (four- and six-core CPUs are also frequently found in both), a mobile CPU’s maximum power consumption is frequently much lower. The average base and boost clock rates might also be slower, and the processor might not enable multithreading. However, a lot of desktop PC customers will be able to do their daily tasks and a little more with these lower-powered CPUs.</p><p>Common users should look for an Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 for a typical tower with a true desktop-grade</p><p>CPU; the Core i7 and Ryzen 7 are also excellent, powerful options, but overkill for most people who aren’t</p><p>serious PC gamers, intensive multitaskers, prosumer or pro video or image manipulators. However, if CPU</p><p>power is a top priority, these should be adequate.</p><p>Only if you are aware that your workflow is being slowed down by insufficient cores or threads or if you have</p><p>extremely high internal storage requirements are the Core i9, Ryzen 9, Ryzen Threadripper, and Core X-Series</p><p>worth the money (for which the Threadripper and Core X can help with internal resources).</p><h2 id="Part-4-What-graphics-card-do-you-need"><a href="#Part-4-What-graphics-card-do-you-need" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. What graphics card do you need?"></a>Part 4. What graphics card do you need?</h2><p>If you want to construct your own PC or purchase the greatest gaming PC, investing in the best graphics card is essential. More crucial than the CPU is the graphics card. Unfortunately, figuring out how to purchase a GPU might be challenging. There are other factors to consider, including the type of monitor you’re using (for</p><p>suggestions, check our Best Gaming Monitors page, which opens in a new browser), the size of your PC case,</p><p>and the game settings you want to use.</p><p>The considerations you should make while choosing your next GPU are listed below. To evaluate how today’s</p><p>GPUs stack up against earlier cards that you might be wanting to replace or upgrade, check out our list of the</p><p>best graphics cards available right now. You can also view the GPU Benchmarks Hierarchy.</p><p>Thankfully, the supply and GPU costs for AMD’s RX 6000 cards and Nvidia’s RTX 30-series cards both continue</p><p>to rise. After 18 months of exorbitant costs, the majority of cards can now be obtained online for only 20–30%</p><p>over MSRP, occasionally even less. However, keep in mind that next-generation GPUs, like as the Nvidia ‘Ada’</p><p>RTX 40-series and AMD’s RDNA3, are soon to be released.</p><p>Even though there are several manufacturers and hundreds of graphics cards, only Nvidia and AMD actually</p><p>produce the GPUs that power these devices; however, Intel’s Xe Graphics has started shipping for laptops and</p><p>will likely be available for desktops in the near future as well. AMD is more competitive than it has been in</p><p>recent years with Nvidia and its current-generation Ampere cards, including the GeForce RTX 3080, thanks to</p><p>its RX 6000 cards.</p><p>But real-time ray tracing is the unseen, realistically lit elephant in the room that we have been ignoring up to</p><p>this point. “Team Green” is now using its second generation of RTX with 30-series GPUs, which was first</p><p>introduced as a significant new feature with Nvidia’s then-current-generation RTX 20-series cards. With its RX 6000 cards, AMD (“Team Red”) made a significant entry into this market in 2020. However, because real-time ray tracing is still new to AMD, it trails behind Nvidia in this area.</p><p>However, the development of games that use ray tracing effectively has lagged behind. There’s no denying that more games are adding ray tracing functionality, and there will be a lot more in the future since the Sony</p><p>PlayStation 5 and Microsoft Series S|X consoles also support it. There are currently just a select few video</p><p>games that make use of ray tracing in a manner that we would consider to be outstanding.</p><p>The value for the money will be significantly increased by going down a notch or two. For instance, an RTX 3080 12GB is now available for under $1,000. Those costs half as much as the RTX 3090 Ti and has an average</p><p>performance reduction of 15%. The AMD side is the same. The RX 6700 XT (opens in new tab) is available for</p><p>half as much as the RX 6900 XT (opens in new tab), which costs approximately $1,050. The 6900 is undoubtedly</p><p>speedier, but is it really worth spending twice as much money? You are the only one who can make the choice.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The functioning of your PC and the purposes for which you use it will determine which computer brand is ideal. If you prefer Windows operating systems, Dell and Lenovo offer excellent desktop computers, but Apple also makes excellent desktop computers if you can afford how pricey they may be. On the other hand, if you’re searching for the best gaming PC, you should consider brands like MSI, Corsair, or even Dell-owned Alienware if you want a PC with gaming skills. The ideal computer brand for you will ultimately rely on what you want your PC to be able to do as many computer brands offer the highest quality, most reasonably priced PCs.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p></article## Part 1\. How much does a desktop cost?<p>The value the desktop offers are among its most attractive claims. With desktop PCs and their components,</p><p>your money just goes further. Instead of spending $600 on a laptop with a capable Intel Core i5 processor, you could spend the same amount of money on a desktop with a Core i7 CPU and perhaps even room for a</p><p>dedicated graphics card.</p><p>For very light labor and display-signage activities, entire micro-PCs are available for about $300, while perfectly functional small towers are available for between $300 and $600. Starting at about $600, gaming desktops with discrete graphics cards are available. All-in-one desktops, which include the display and all of the computer hardware in a single unit, are also available and start at about $450.</p><p>With desktops, you don’t run some of the same risks that you would with a laptop of comparable price. For</p><p>basic computing, a $250 Black Friday deal or a heavily discounted used desktop could work just fine, and you</p><p>wouldn’t have to worry about the cheap materials wearing out the way you could with a laptop of a comparable price. The whims of daily commuting and the sporadic drop from a coffee table would befall that</p><p>cheap laptop. However, the desktop would have to remain stationary and continue to function.</p><p>Business workstations, blinged-out gaming rigs, and exquisitely constructed all-in-one PCs that cost several</p><p>thousand dollars are available at the top of the market. A $3,000 gaming tower will not only provide enormous</p><p>computational capability for today, but it should also have so much room for growth and upgradeability that it will have a considerably longer useful life than any laptop. And that’s before you even explore the wacky world of custom PCs, which includes paint jobs that rival those on automobiles, liquid cooling, and extravagant</p><p>lighting and wiring.</p><p>Business PCs that are IT-manageable and security-conscious—the majority of which are now produced by Dell, HP, and Lenovo—have their own price dynamics and generally cost more. This is due to their expensive</p><p>warranty or maintenance packages as well as the potential addition of enterprise-specific silicon with a</p><p>manageability or security focus. Sometimes, a portion of the price premium for business desktops reflects the</p><p>PC manufacturer’s promise to keep extra parts and upgrades in stock for that model of computers for a specific amount of time in the future. As a result, IT professionals may rely on being able to maintain a fleet of a specific business machine for that period.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-desktops-are-recommended-1"><a href="#Part-2-What-desktops-are-recommended-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

However, keep in mind that next-generation GPUs, like as the Nvidia ‘Ada’</p><p>RTX 40-series and AMD’s RDNA3, are soon to be released.</p><p>Even though there are several manufacturers and hundreds of graphics cards, only Nvidia and AMD actually</p><p>produce the GPUs that power these devices; however, Intel’s Xe Graphics has started shipping for laptops and</p><p>will likely be available for desktops in the near future as well. AMD is more competitive than it has been in</p><p>recent years with Nvidia and its current-generation Ampere cards, including the GeForce RTX 3080, thanks to</p><p>its RX 6000 cards.</p><p>But real-time ray tracing is the unseen, realistically lit elephant in the room that we have been ignoring up to</p><p>this point. “Team Green” is now using its second generation of RTX with 30-series GPUs, which was first</p><p>introduced as a significant new feature with Nvidia’s then-current-generation RTX 20-series cards. With its RX 6000 cards, AMD (“Team Red”) made a significant entry into this market in 2020. However, because real-time ray tracing is still new to AMD, it trails behind Nvidia in this area.</p><p>However, the development of games that use ray tracing effectively has lagged behind. There’s no denying that more games are adding ray tracing functionality, and there will be a lot more in the future since the Sony</p><p>PlayStation 5 and Microsoft Series S|X consoles also support it. There are currently just a select few video</p><p>games that make use of ray tracing in a manner that we would consider to be outstanding.</p><p>The value for the money will be significantly increased by going down a notch or two. For instance, an RTX 3080 12GB is now available for under $1,000. Those costs half as much as the RTX 3090 Ti and has an average</p><p>performance reduction of 15%. The AMD side is the same. The RX 6700 XT (opens in new tab) is available for</p><p>half as much as the RX 6900 XT (opens in new tab), which costs approximately $1,050. The 6900 is undoubtedly</p><p>speedier, but is it really worth spending twice as much money? You are the only one who can make the choice.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The functioning of your PC and the purposes for which you use it will determine which computer brand is ideal. If you prefer Windows operating systems, Dell and Lenovo offer excellent desktop computers, but Apple also makes excellent desktop computers if you can afford how pricey they may be. On the other hand, if you’re searching for the best gaming PC, you should consider brands like MSI, Corsair, or even Dell-owned Alienware if you want a PC with gaming skills. The ideal computer brand for you will ultimately rely on what you want your PC to be able to do as many computer brands offer the highest quality, most reasonably priced PCs.</p><p><a class="link"

Filmmakers are now able to create wonders with cinematic, jaw dropping results that were earlier just impossible in Hollywood productions. But if you are new to this world of drone then you must be searching for some information regarding how to shoot aerial videos using drone to get professional results. If so, then don’t worry! Because the article below will provide you complete information about impressive filming techniques with latest drones.</p><p> Let’s check a video tutorial first:</p><h2 id="Tips-for-Filming-with-Drone"><a href="#Tips-for-Filming-with-Drone" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Filming with Drone"></a>Tips for Filming with Drone</h2><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Techniques</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Weather</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Camera</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Editing</a></li></ul><h3 id="Techniques"><a href="#Techniques" class="headerlink" title="Techniques"></a>Techniques</h3><p> In order to get best results with your aerial shoot, try these professional techniques:</p><h4 id="1-Go-Slow"><a href="#1-Go-Slow" class="headerlink" title="1.  Go Slow"></a>1.  Go Slow</h4><p> The very first recommendation to beginners from professionals is to move slowly. It leaves cinematic impression on viewers as your slow motion makes them think that you are shooting from a larger platform such as helicopter. No doubt, it will increase the production value and shots will appear perfectly crafted and well controlled.</p><p> Ensure that you operate RC control stick very smoothly. Take help from gradual movements so that undesired shakes in footage can be avoided and at the same time care about slow acceleration and deceleration to avoid distortion from end results.</p><p> It is good to pre-plan as well as visual most of your aerial shots. One should prefer to advance guard his filming location so that all pros and cons can be pre-observed and proper planning can be done to get rid of limitations of that area. If you know your requirements in advance and have an effective plan for the site then you will definitely be able to make most out of your limited battery life of drone. You will not feel happy if some shots are missed just because of mismanagement and drained drone battery.</p><h4 id="2-Two-Axis-type-Movement"><a href="#2-Two-Axis-type-Movement" class="headerlink" title="2.  Two Axis type Movement"></a>2.  Two Axis type Movement</h4><p> There are few hidden tricks behind those breathtaking shots of big budget movies and it is good to implement them with care. Most of those professionals prefer to implement two axis type movements simultaneously. They often make some arrangements to fly backwards as well as downwards at the same time but note that such movements must be controlled at much smoother rate with stable adjustments.</p><h4 id="3-Strafe"><a href="#3-Strafe" class="headerlink" title="3.  Strafe"></a>3.  Strafe</h4><p> When you have to focus on attractive landscapes then the best idea is to use sideways movements or the strafing feature. It will help you to show landscapes with different prospective and results will naturally be more impressive. Usually, most of the shots over landscapes in Hollywood movies are recorded with aerial motions where drone keep on moving forward and backward, so if you try the strafing effect then it will definitely be a unique and awesome idea. This recording style will also help you to reveal various eye catching features of the landscape.</p><h4 id="4-Orbit"><a href="#4-Orbit" class="headerlink" title="4.  Orbit"></a>4.  Orbit</h4><p> If you want to achieve Orbit then you have to control your drone strafe movements towards left or right side while pulling that yaw stick to exactly opposite direction. Let me make it clear that yaw stick is a control stick that you will find on left side of your drone controller and it is there to control rotation action of drone. Note that, you need to have more practice on that yaw control because most of users, even professionals end up spinning much faster and results are too bad.</p><h4 id="5-Fly-Through-Shots"><a href="#5-Fly-Through-Shots" class="headerlink" title="5.  Fly Through Shots"></a>5.  Fly Through Shots</h4><p> Here is something more cinematic but it is going to be risky enough. You need to be more careful to capture this type of shots because it demands you complete attention on controller screen for drone navigation. If you believe on your piloting skills then you will definitely achieve success in this recording action. When these shots are captured perfectly, they have power to capture attention of viewers and they will soon become fan of your cinematography skills along with your risk management strategy.</p><h3 id="Weather"><a href="#Weather" class="headerlink" title="Weather"></a>Weather</h3><p> When we talk about weather then it is something out of your control and you have just one option that is to pray mercy from Mother Nature. To capture some of the best shots you will often need to fly in a clean sky and you definitely don’t need that heavy fog and rain. This issue is more common in winter days, especially when you are working on high altitudes that get freeze due to cold.</p><p><strong>What to do?</strong></p><ul><li>The first most important trick is to avoid taking shots in windy day. Generally, most of the advanced drone units can bear the pressure of up to 25-35 mph wind but if it goes above this range then your footage will get spoiled. It is not a good idea to simply rely on post processing techniques like jello effect etc. However, few professionals are able to refine their shots with Wrap Stabilization Setting to get best results.</li><li>Choose golden hours of the day to shoot your footage. The time of sunset and sunrise will help your footage to stand out as shadows are highly visible during this time and it will naturally create a natural impact. People rarely shoot scenes at sunrise time so you can try to implement this trick to prove yourself different from those common aerial shooters.</li></ul><h3 id="Camera"><a href="#Camera" class="headerlink" title="Camera"></a>Camera</h3><p> Some of the most common camera settings that demand your focus are flat image profile and shutter speed.</p><ul><li>**Flat Image Profile:**There is no doubt to say that your camera settings are going to leave great impact on your footage so use them effectively. Prefer to work on flattest camera profile as it will help you to get impressive dynamic range with aerial camera. This technique of shooting helps users to prevent clouds and sky and also helps users to retain details from darkest point on ground.</li><li><strong>Control Shutter Speed:</strong><br> It is good to work with lower shutter speed and in order to avoid strobing effect one must prefer to shot by keeping camera close to ground. Keep it somewhere around 100th to 250th level of second, one can also work with ND filter to control shutter speed to desired lower level. In case if you work with 500th or 100th part of second then you will naturally obtain sharper frames with it leads to footage with heavy strobing.</li></ul><h3 id="Editing"><a href="#Editing" class="headerlink" title="Editing"></a>Editing</h3><p> If you need to edit your shots to get customized results then it is most important to choose a professional and high quality software tool.

You can either prefer to use the “Import” option directly or work with drag and drop functions that can bring all desired files immediately to software timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-editor-main-interface-1.jpg"                      alt="import videos"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Cut Videos:</strong></p><p> Simply move the slider position to the specific point on your video from where you need to cut it down. In case if you want to remove any specific part permanently then split it using cut option and then use delete button from right menu or from toolbar to remove it.

But note that, you need to save those multiple sections of files one by one while deleting the unwanted portions.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Scene Detection:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/scene-detection.jpg"                      alt="scene detection"                ></p><p> If you want to reach to certain segment of video quickly then use scene detection function. Just highlight your video on item tray and then right click, from the drop down menu, select “Scene Detection” option and now you can immediately separate your video into various parts as per need.

Use Long Exposures"></a>1.  Use Long Exposures</h4><p> The exposure is the amount of time the camera’s sensor is exposed to light. If you are taking a photo in broad daylight exposure value is going to 1&#x2F;800 of a second or even less, while if you find yourself in a situation where light is scarce the exposure value should be anywhere between 3 to 30 seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/long-exposure-iphone.jpg"                      alt="long-exposure-iphone"                ></p><p> Image resource: iOS Gadget Hacks</p><p> In low light scenes, the long exposure will help your camera gather more light.

Make Sure that Your iPhone is Perfectly Still</h4><p> Any camera shake that occurs while the camera shutter is open will result in blurry photos. The exposure value you set determines how long the shutter is going to be open.</p><p> Holding a camera still for a long period of time is impossible, which is the reason why you should get a tripod if you want to take sharp night photos. Finding other ways to keep your iPhone steady, such as placing it on a firm, flat surface is also an option.</p><h4 id="3-Experiment-with-Ambient-Light-and-Shadows"><a href="#3-Experiment-with-Ambient-Light-and-Shadows" class="headerlink" title="3.

This can be done using various devices, such as smart gloves, often known as data gloves.</p><p>In this article, we’ll discuss <strong>Hand Tracking</strong> technology, its various applications, and how to create it using Python, OpenCV, and Media Pipe.</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Tracking With Interface</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Tracking Without Interface</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">What is OpenCV</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-2">What Is Media Pipe</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-3">Guidance With Steps</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">Use Filmora to demonstarte your Hand Tracking skill</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Hand-Tracking-Where-Is-It-Applied"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Hand-Tracking-Where-Is-It-Applied" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Hand Tracking? Where Is It Applied?"></a>Part 1. What Is Hand Tracking? Where Is It Applied?</h2><p>Hand Tracking refers to the process of tracking the position and movement of a user’s hands in virtual reality. This is usually done using a combination of sensors, including cameras, infrared sensors, or ultrasonic sensors.</p><p>By tracking the user’s hands, VR systems can provide more immersive and interactive experiences. For example, Hand Tracking can be used to allow users to interact with virtual objects, as well as to provide input for gestures and body language.</p><p>The Oculus Quest 2 is a virtual reality headset that immerses you in virtual worlds. Quest 2’s one of the coolest features is Hand Tracking, which lets you interact with the virtual world around you using your hands.</p><p>With Hand Tracking, you can interact with the virtual world more naturally and intuitively. You can use your hands to pick up objects, draw, and even type on a virtual keyboard. Moreover, it opens up new possibilities for gameplay, allowing you to play games in new and innovative ways.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/hand-tracking-technology.jpg"                      alt="hand tracking technology"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking"><a href="#Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking"></a>Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking</h2><p>There are two main types of Hand Tracking: with interface and without interface:</p><h3 id="Tracking-With-Interface"><a href="#Tracking-With-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Tracking With Interface"></a>Tracking With Interface</h3><p>With interface Hand Tracking, you need to use a device such as a glove or a controller to interact with the virtual world. This can be used in VR or AR applications. It is further divided into two systems:</p><p><strong>1. Inertial Motion Capture Gloves</strong></p><p>Inertial motion capture gloves use sensors Inertial Measurement Units or IMUs with built-in sensors to track the movement of your hands. These sensors include gyroscopes, accelerometers, and sometimes magnetometers for measuring angular rate, detecting gravitational force and acceleration, and measuring the earth’s magnetic field, respectively.</p><p>These gloves can be used for a variety of purposes, such as gaming, virtual reality, and motion capture for movies and video games. Inertial motion capture gloves are becoming increasingly popular as they offer a more immersive experience than traditional controllers.</p><p><strong>2. Optical Motion Capture Systems</strong></p><p>Optical motion capture is a process that uses cameras and reflective sensors to track movement in three-dimensional space. These systems are often used in movies and video games to create realistic animations.</p><p>Optical motion capture systems emit infrared light from the camera. The markers reflect light, which is then captured by cameras. The movement of the markers is then used to create a three-dimensional model of the object.</p><p>The more cameras used, the more accurate the results. While this technology is very precise, it can be limited by factors such as body position and movement.</p><h3 id="Tracking-Without-Interface"><a href="#Tracking-Without-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Tracking Without Interface"></a>Tracking Without Interface</h3><p>Also known as Markerless Hand Tracking, this type of Hand Tracking allows users to track their hand movements without the need for any external markers or data gloves, meaning more spontaneous interaction and freedom of movement. This could hugely impact everything from gaming to virtual reality to human-computer interaction.</p><p>Right now, markerless Hand Tracking is still in its early stages, with a few limitations. However, as this technology continues to develop, we will likely see more and more applications for it in the future.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking"><a href="#Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking</h2><p>Above we have learned what is Hand Tracking and the two types of it. Now let’s see how we can create a hand tracking with two Python Libraries - OpenCV and MediaPipe.</p><p>Before we go further about them, let us learn about Python quickly. Python is a versatile language used for a wide range of tasks, including image processing and computer vision. We will use Python and two Python Libraries: OpenCV and MediaPipe, to create a Hand Tracking module.</p><h3 id="What-is-OpenCV"><a href="#What-is-OpenCV" class="headerlink" title="What is OpenCV"></a>What is OpenCV</h3><p>To get a deeper understanding of OpenCV, please read our article: <em>Opencv Tracking, a compete review</em>.（同期交付文章，请插入相关内链~）</p><h3 id="What-Is-Media-Pipe"><a href="#What-Is-Media-Pipe" class="headerlink" title="What Is Media Pipe"></a>What Is Media Pipe</h3><p>Media Pipe is an open-source framework by Google that provides a set of tools for working with multimedia data or media processing. It includes modules for handling audio, video, and images. Media Pipe also supports various codecs and file formats.</p><p>There are two stages for creating a Hand Tracking program using MediaPipe:</p><ol><li><strong>Palm Detection</strong>: In the first stage, MediaPipe has to work with the entire input image, providing a cropped image of the hand.</li><li><strong>Hand Landmarks Identification</strong>: In the second stage, the framework works with the cropped image of the hand to find 21 hand landmarks.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/20-hand-landmarks-for-identifiction-hand-tracking.jpg"                      alt="20 hand landmarks for identifiction – hand tracking"                ></p><h3 id="Guidance-With-Steps"><a href="#Guidance-With-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Guidance With Steps"></a>Guidance With Steps</h3><p>Before starting to create Hand Tracking, you need to install the <a class="link"   href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows" >Pycharm IDE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>app on your PC.

What Is Hand Tracking? Where Is It Applied?"></a>Part 1. What Is Hand Tracking? Where Is It Applied?</h2><p>Hand Tracking refers to the process of tracking the position and movement of a user’s hands in virtual reality. This is usually done using a combination of sensors, including cameras, infrared sensors, or ultrasonic sensors.</p><p>By tracking the user’s hands, VR systems can provide more immersive and interactive experiences. For example, Hand Tracking can be used to allow users to interact with virtual objects, as well as to provide input for gestures and body language.</p><p>The Oculus Quest 2 is a virtual reality headset that immerses you in virtual worlds. Quest 2’s one of the coolest features is Hand Tracking, which lets you interact with the virtual world around you using your hands.</p><p>With Hand Tracking, you can interact with the virtual world more naturally and intuitively. You can use your hands to pick up objects, draw, and even type on a virtual keyboard. Moreover, it opens up new possibilities for gameplay, allowing you to play games in new and innovative ways.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/hand-tracking-technology.jpg"                      alt="hand tracking technology"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking-1"><a href="#Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking"></a>Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking</h2><p>There are two main types of Hand Tracking: with interface and without interface:</p><h3 id="Tracking-With-Interface-1"><a href="#Tracking-With-Interface-1" class="headerlink" title="Tracking With Interface"></a>Tracking With Interface</h3><p>With interface Hand Tracking, you need to use a device such as a glove or a controller to interact with the virtual world. This can be used in VR or AR applications. It is further divided into two systems:</p><p><strong>1. Inertial Motion Capture Gloves</strong></p><p>Inertial motion capture gloves use sensors Inertial Measurement Units or IMUs with built-in sensors to track the movement of your hands. These sensors include gyroscopes, accelerometers, and sometimes magnetometers for measuring angular rate, detecting gravitational force and acceleration, and measuring the earth’s magnetic field, respectively.</p><p>These gloves can be used for a variety of purposes, such as gaming, virtual reality, and motion capture for movies and video games. Inertial motion capture gloves are becoming increasingly popular as they offer a more immersive experience than traditional controllers.</p><p><strong>2. Optical Motion Capture Systems</strong></p><p>Optical motion capture is a process that uses cameras and reflective sensors to track movement in three-dimensional space. These systems are often used in movies and video games to create realistic animations.</p><p>Optical motion capture systems emit infrared light from the camera. The markers reflect light, which is then captured by cameras. The movement of the markers is then used to create a three-dimensional model of the object.</p><p>The more cameras used, the more accurate the results. While this technology is very precise, it can be limited by factors such as body position and movement.</p><h3 id="Tracking-Without-Interface-1"><a href="#Tracking-Without-Interface-1" class="headerlink" title="Tracking Without Interface"></a>Tracking Without Interface</h3><p>Also known as Markerless Hand Tracking, this type of Hand Tracking allows users to track their hand movements without the need for any external markers or data gloves, meaning more spontaneous interaction and freedom of movement. This could hugely impact everything from gaming to virtual reality to human-computer interaction.</p><p>Right now, markerless Hand Tracking is still in its early stages, with a few limitations. However, as this technology continues to develop, we will likely see more and more applications for it in the future.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking-1"><a href="#Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking</h2><p>Above we have learned what is Hand Tracking and the two types of it. Now let’s see how we can create a hand tracking with two Python Libraries - OpenCV and MediaPipe.</p><p>Before we go further about them, let us learn about Python quickly. Python is a versatile language used for a wide range of tasks, including image processing and computer vision. We will use Python and two Python Libraries: OpenCV and MediaPipe, to create a Hand Tracking module.</p><h3 id="What-is-OpenCV-1"><a href="#What-is-OpenCV-1" class="headerlink" title="What is OpenCV"></a>What is OpenCV</h3><p>To get a deeper understanding of OpenCV, please read our article: <em>Opencv Tracking, a compete review</em>.（同期交付文章，请插入相关内链~）</p><h3 id="What-Is-Media-Pipe-1"><a href="#What-Is-Media-Pipe-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is Media Pipe"></a>What Is Media Pipe</h3><p>Media Pipe is an open-source framework by Google that provides a set of tools for working with multimedia data or media processing. It includes modules for handling audio, video, and images. Media Pipe also supports various codecs and file formats.</p><p>There are two stages for creating a Hand Tracking program using MediaPipe:</p><ol><li><strong>Palm Detection</strong>: In the first stage, MediaPipe has to work with the entire input image, providing a cropped image of the hand.</li><li><strong>Hand Landmarks Identification</strong>: In the second stage, the framework works with the cropped image of the hand to find 21 hand landmarks.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/20-hand-landmarks-for-identifiction-hand-tracking.jpg"                      alt="20 hand landmarks for identifiction – hand tracking"                ></p><h3 id="Guidance-With-Steps-1"><a href="#Guidance-With-Steps-1" class="headerlink" title="Guidance With Steps"></a>Guidance With Steps</h3><p>Before starting to create Hand Tracking, you need to install the <a class="link"   href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows" >Pycharm IDE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>app on your PC.

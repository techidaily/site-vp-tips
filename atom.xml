Not everybody can afford professional lighting equipment for their YouTube channels. It’s a big investment, especially if you think of your channel as a hobby. Sometimes even if you have a lighting kit you do not want to set up multiple lights and stands to every time you shoot a vlog entry. You might be shooting them every day. It is great to have lighting equipment, and it is also great to know when you can get around it.</p><h2 id="How-to-Get-Best-Natural-Lighting-Indoors"><a href="#How-to-Get-Best-Natural-Lighting-Indoors" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Best Natural Lighting Indoors"></a>How to Get Best Natural Lighting Indoors</h2><p> Using a window as your main light source is a simple way to get high quality lighting on a budget. When it is bright outside a window is as powerful as any light you might have. So, besides just being cheap, windows can actually make your YouTube videos look amazing.</p><h4 id="1-Windows-as-Key-Lights"><a href="#1-Windows-as-Key-Lights" class="headerlink" title="1. Windows as Key Lights"></a>1. Windows as Key Lights</h4><p> When you shoot near a window you can treat that window the same as the key light in a three-point lighting set up.</p><p> In three-point lighting you have a key light, a fill light, and a main light. Your key light, in this case your window, is off to one side. It will cast a shadow over half of your face which you soften using your fill light. Your backlight is a light you put behind you to help you pop out of your background.</p><p> Another thing that can help you pop out from your background is focusing your keylight so that its light is only landing on you, not your background.</p><p> Rather than setting up professional lights for your fill and backlights try using household lamps or reflectors. Reflectors are used to bounce light from another source, so if you set one up opposite to the window it will redirect light back at the shaded side of your face.</p><p> Reflectors are very affordable, often around $20, but if you do not have one then you can use a sheet of aluminum foil.</p><h4 id="2-Windows-as-Front-Lights"><a href="#2-Windows-as-Front-Lights" class="headerlink" title="2. Windows as Front Lights"></a>2. Windows as Front Lights</h4><p> Vlogging while facing a window is a great way to get even lighting over your entire face. This is a great set up for makeup tutorials or other beauty vlogs. It can also work for opinion vloggers, or any other vlogging genre where the focus is on a stationary host, though.</p><p> The only issue that can arise when you use a window as a front light for your vlog is that you do not stand out from your background because the lighting is even on both you and it. This is not difficult to get around; you just need a backlight.</p><p> You can use a household lamp or a reflector as a backlight. The idea is that the light hitting you from behind will create a boarder around you that will make you pop out from the background of your shot.</p><h4 id="3-Windows-as-Backlights"><a href="#3-Windows-as-Backlights" class="headerlink" title="3. Windows as Backlights"></a>3. Windows as Backlights</h4><p> It is usually a bad idea to use a window as a backlight because they are too bright. Shooting with a window behind you will not just give you a dark boarder, like a lamp or a reflector; it will completely transform you into a silhouette. This is an interesting effect in some situations, but not in a vlog where your viewers are expecting to be able to see you. It is sometimes possible to make this kind of shot work by increasing your exposure, but then you might end up with over-exposed footage. Pushing the ‘info’ button a couple times will allow you to check you exposure on most DSLRs.</p><h4 id="4-Diffusers"><a href="#4-Diffusers" class="headerlink" title="4. Diffusers"></a>4. Diffusers</h4><p> A diffuser is a screen of translucent fabric you can use to soften your light. The light coming from your window might be hard on your eyes, and setting up a diffuser between you and your window can help you not to blink. Often when reflectors come in colored sets one of the ‘colors’ will be translucent and you can use it as a diffuser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-full-inspection-gopro-silver-hero4-detailed-review/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Full Inspection  GoPro Silver Hero4 Detailed Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-which-is-superior-in-media-management-vlc-or-mx/"><u>[New] Which Is Superior in Media Management  VLC or MX?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-thank-you-access-comprehensive-paidfree-templates/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Thank You!

It really doesn’t matter what kind of use you put a camera – creative shots, hands-free convenience, or stationary surveillance. For shots that require slow motion, time-lapses, or simply capturing movement, handling tripods are way too much hassle. And when the times (and shots) are too rocky, they’re just not enough to stabilize and focus.</p><p>For times when you’re on a tight budget or with no room for extra equipment, or if you simply aren’t well versed with complex camera functions but love to shoot, the auto-track camera gives way to your creativity to shine.</p><ol><li><strong>What Is The Price Of A Tracking Camera?</strong></li></ol><p>The price of an auto track camera can widely vary according to the features, quality, brand, and additional accessories that you are looking for. On the lower end, you can get a face-tracking camera for $400. At this low price, you may get a decent camera that auto tracks, but it may also mean a compromise on durability, sensor precision, resolution, and quality, among other things.</p><p>On the higher end, with loaded features, high resolution, flexibility in lenses, sound audio recording, you can expect the price to range between one to a few grand easily.</p><ol><li><strong>Where To Buy An Auto Tracking Camera For Sports?</strong></li></ol><p>It is easy to purchase an auto-tracking camera for sports, thanks to the convenience of online shopping. You can find most of these cameras on sites like Amazon at the standard price set by the manufacturer. Also, there is the official company’s e-commerce page and more affiliate blogs and vendors that you can shop from. If you want to physically buy, you can get them at your nearest electronics showrooms.</p><p>To sum it up, when buying an auto track camera, always consider your needs and uses. Each camera specializes in meeting a set of performance expectations. For instance, vlogging needs better resolution, conferences need more precision, and sports need more movement flexibility. Once you have your priorities sorted, this guide is exhaustive to help you with your buying decision.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/illuminating-shadows-iphone-photo-magic/"><u>Illuminating Shadows  IPhone Photo Magic</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-acoustic-additions-for-your-chat-status/"><u>In 2024, Acoustic Additions for Your Chat Status</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mastering-the-art-of-affordable-data-storage-cloud/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Mastering the Art of Affordable Data Storage (Cloud)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-high-tech-vr-handhelds-our-top-10-list-for-2024/"><u>[New] High-Tech VR Handhelds  Our Top 10 List for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-imagination-drought-hindering-vr-development/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  The Imagination Drought Hindering VR Development</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-professional-photogridding-services-to-polish-your-art/"><u>[Updated] Professional Photogridding Services to Polish Your Art</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/iconic-14-examples-of-animate-texts-for-2024/"><u>Iconic 14 Examples of Animate Texts for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-photography-tutorial-how-to-shoot-and-create-impressive-hdr-portraits/"><u>2024 Approved  Photography Tutorial  How to Shoot and Create Impressive HDR Portraits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-innovative-prime-lenses-for-professionals-shooting-4k/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Innovative Prime Lenses for Professionals Shooting 4K</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-premium-pfr-rate-for-easy-going-footage/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Premium PFR Rate for Easy-Going Footage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-15-ultimate-game-recorder-software-reviewed-and-rated/"><u>[Updated] 15 Ultimate Game Recorder Software Reviewed & Rated</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-add-audio-in-after-effects/"><u>Updated How to Add Audio in After Effects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/reasons-for-nubia-z50s-pro-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Reasons for Nubia Z50S Pro Stuck on Startup Screen and Ways To Fix Them | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-photographers-guide-to-effective-watermarking/"><u>2024 Approved  Photographers' Guide to Effective Watermarking</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/from-small-screens-to-big-screen-success-fb-video-guide-2023-for-2024/"><u>From Small Screens to Big Screen Success  FB Video Guide 2023 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/fixing-foneazy-mockgo-not-working-on-oppo-a78-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Fixing Foneazy MockGo Not Working On Oppo A78 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-hdmi-radeon-revival-for-2024/"><u>[New] HDMI Radeon Revival for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-supercharge-visual-and-aural-aspects-of-media-content/"><u>New 2024 Approved Supercharge Visual & Aural Aspects of Media Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/identify-malfunctioning-your-hardware-drivers-with-windows-device-manager-on-windows-11-by-drivereasy-guide/"><u>Identify malfunctioning your hardware drivers with Windows Device Manager on Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-instagram-exit-wave-analysis/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Instagram Exit Wave Analysis</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It’s up to you to decide everything about the podcast, like the episode’s length, topics, and more.</p><p>In this article, we’ll break down some of the things you want to consider before starting your solo podcast, so stick to the end.</p><ol><li><a href="#part5-1">The Rob Auton Daily</a></li><li><a href="#part5-2">You Must Remember This</a></li><li><a href="#part5-3">Live From the 405</a></li><li><a href="#part5-4">Have You Heard George’s Podcast</a></li><li><a href="#part5-5">Casefile True Crime</a></li><li><a href="#part5-6">This American Life</a></li><li><a href="#part5-7">WTF with Marc Maron</a></li><li><a href="#part5-8">Reply All</a></li><li><a href="#part5-9">The Lazy Genius Podcast</a></li><li><a href="#part5-10">Say Your Mind</a></li></ol><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Solo-Podcasting"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Solo-Podcasting" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

Why Solo Podcasting?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/solo-podcasting-1.jpg"                      alt="solo podcasting"                ></p><p>Solo podcasting is all about the personal connection with listeners. It’s a chance to express yourself, a platform to share your ideas and thoughts with people. Also, to show people who you are and what you’re about—the beauty of solo podcasting. You are free, and it’s a great feeling. The idea is simple: You are the protagonist of your own story.</p><h3 id="Go-at-your-own-pace"><a href="#Go-at-your-own-pace" class="headerlink" title="Go at your own pace"></a>Go at your own pace</h3><p>Working on your own gives flexibility with working hours you wouldn’t get as part of a team. That means you can work at your own pace and not feel pressured by a deadline or fear failing since knowing no one but yourself is listening.</p><p>It also means you can work at your own pace as a podcast host without waiting for your audience to be ready.</p><h3 id="Content-is-totally-under-your-control"><a href="#Content-is-totally-under-your-control" class="headerlink" title="Content is totally under your control"></a>Content is totally under your control</h3><p>You’re always controlling your content while working in a solo podcaster scenario. No one else tells you what to say; no one tells you how to say it.</p><p>The upside is that you don’t have to worry about getting your ideas “out there,” which allows you to be creative.No but yourself can dictate the tone of your show.</p><p>Solo podcasters don’t have anyone else to compete with, and they get to choose what they talk about. You’re in full control over everything, which means no advertisers or sponsors are dictating your message.</p><p>That means you can ensure that you deliver a compelling story that people want to hear.</p><h3 id="Post-Production-is-Easier"><a href="#Post-Production-is-Easier" class="headerlink" title="Post-Production is Easier"></a>Post-Production is Easier</h3><p>When you work alone, you can take time to make changes or re-edits. Post-production is also easier to deal with if you don’t have the pressure to deliver something at a certain time.</p><h3 id="Connect-with-Your-Audience-on-a-Deeper-Level"><a href="#Connect-with-Your-Audience-on-a-Deeper-Level" class="headerlink" title="Connect with Your Audience on a Deeper Level"></a>Connect with Your Audience on a Deeper Level</h3><p>Solo podcasting is one of the most efficient ways to build relationships with your audience and connect with them deeper.</p><p>When you’re just starting, your audiences don’t know who you are. So you’ll likely struggle to connect with them on a personal level. But By developing a solo podcast, you allow yourself to develop a personal brand while building a network of people who share your same passion and interests.</p><p>Keep your content focused on your unique story, and be as transparent as possible when you get started. Most listeners prefer to connect with the hosts they find on podcasts than on other media, And Solo Podcast listeners trust their hosts as experts on their topics.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Bang-Up-Solo-Podcast"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Bang-Up-Solo-Podcast" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Make a Bang-Up Solo Podcast"></a>Part 2. How to Make a Bang-Up Solo Podcast</h2><p>Now, we are going to look into the ins and outs of creating a Bang-Up Solo Podcast that would grab your viewers’ maximum attention.

Secondly, before creating an episode, our Listeners may want to hear the story behind the product, so it’s helpful to explain why you built it, what your goals were, what you learned, what you got done, and how the product has evolved.</p><p>It will help you give clear instructions for deciding on solo episode topics that are creative, unique, helpful &amp; engaging to share.</p><h3 id="An-outline-for-an-episode"><a href="#An-outline-for-an-episode" class="headerlink" title="An outline for an episode"></a>An outline for an episode</h3><p>One common mistake when creating a podcast is jumping into it without a plan. Therefore it’s important to have some roadmap for your episode before you even begin working on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/solo-podcasting-3.jpg"                      alt="podcast outline"                ></p><p>An outline for a good episode usually includes an introduction&#x2F;promo, the main topic, a break, a conclusion, and a wrap-up. It helps you understand the topic you want to cover.</p><p>If you don’t have a clear idea of what you want to talk about, you will have trouble following along when you sit down to record. Just be careful not to repeat yourself too much. Don’t try and cover every single aspect of your topic.</p><h3 id="A-hook-for-the-episode-beginning"><a href="#A-hook-for-the-episode-beginning" class="headerlink" title="A hook for the episode beginning"></a>A hook for the episode beginning</h3><p>The hook is the first thing that draws the listener in and sets up the rest of the content. What is it about your show that makes people want to listen? Your hook should always be unique, but a little commonality doesn’t hurt.</p><p>If you’re struggling to come up with a hook for an episode of your podcast, here are a few ideas for you to consider:</p><ul><li>What topic do you enjoy talking about?</li><li>What do you want to learn about?</li><li>Is there something, in particular, you’re interested in?</li></ul><h3 id="Mind-the-length-of-your-solo-podcast"><a href="#Mind-the-length-of-your-solo-podcast" class="headerlink" title="Mind the length of your solo podcast"></a>Mind the length of your solo podcast</h3><p>Length is everything. Podcasting is about the length of your content, and you will struggle if you have a short episode. You need at least 30 minutes of material for your episode, or you risk alienating listeners and driving them away from your brand.</p><p>You’ll lose listeners’ attention if you don’t know what to say during your episode. So instead, think of your podcast as a mini-publication. You can get away with making shorter episodes because you can fill more content into your episodes.</p><h3 id="Recap-the-episode"><a href="#Recap-the-episode" class="headerlink" title="Recap the episode"></a>Recap the episode</h3><p>Recapping the previous episode is a great way to start your podcast. Doing so allows your listeners to quickly catch up while at the same time giving you a chance to share the most relevant information from the last show.</p><p>That way, when the next podcast episode starts, your listeners will already be up-to-date on essential information.</p><h3 id="The-right-tool-for-recording-and-editing"><a href="#The-right-tool-for-recording-and-editing" class="headerlink" title="The right tool for recording and editing"></a>The right tool for recording and editing</h3><p>As the popularity of podcasts continues to grow, so does the need for quality, professional sound recordings and editing tools.</p><p>If you’re a podcaster looking to record and edit, Wondershare Filmora must be your priority.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/solo-podcasting-4.jpg"                      alt="wondershare filmora"                ></p><p>For those who would like to produce podcasts or videos on the go, Wondershare Filmora is not only an easy-to-use video editing software but also a good helper for podcast editing.</p><ul><li>Speech-to-text allows smooth conversion of voiceover to text, making your podcasts more accessible.</li><li>Over 2000+ audio resources range from music, audio effects and much more.</li><li>Remove background noise, fade in, fade out, and do lots more audio editing without hassles.</li><li>Supports many shortcut key commands to help tech-savvy and non-tec-savvy individuals to create and edit podcasts quickly.</li><li>Audio Ducking to easily eliminate background noise and unwanted sound recorded while creating podcasts.</li></ul><p>You can export your episodes as MP3 files, which can then be uploaded to any podcast hosting site like iTunes, Podomatic, and Libsyn.

Tips &amp; Takeaways for Solo Podcasting</h2><p>The world of podcasts is changing, so how can podcasters succeed when there’s so much competition? We asked three podcasters how to get started, who have grown as solo podcasters. Here are their top tips and lessons, plus advice from fellow podcasters.</p><h3 id="Don’t-worry-about-mistakes"><a href="#Don’t-worry-about-mistakes" class="headerlink" title="Don’t worry about mistakes"></a>Don’t worry about mistakes</h3><p>The first tip for solo podcasters is to not worry about making mistakes. We all make mistakes. And when we do, we learn. So don’t stress out over your first podcast. Instead, take notes after each episode and use those as your learning curve. You don’t need to be perfect from the very beginning.</p><h3 id="Practice"><a href="#Practice" class="headerlink" title="Practice"></a>Practice</h3><p>It takes some practice to get the natural flow of conversation going. We recommend practicing speaking in front of a mirror to ensure you sound confident and natural. Once you’ve practiced enough, record yourself, listen back, and play it to see where you’re strong and where you need to improve.</p><h3 id="Stand-a-point"><a href="#Stand-a-point" class="headerlink" title="Stand a point"></a>Stand a point</h3><p>A key part of being a successful podcast host is sticking to your bullet points. While the show is running, there’s no time for you to ramble, so your goal is to make sure you hit all your points and move on quickly.</p><h3 id="Have-fun"><a href="#Have-fun" class="headerlink" title="Have fun"></a>Have fun</h3><p>Having fun doesn’t mean that you’re doing something wrong. But it does mean relaxing. You’re doing something right. People are more likely to listen if they know you’re having fun while you talk. On the other hand, if you take yourself too seriously, people will tune out.</p><h2 id="Part-4-The-challenges-of-making-solo-podcasting"><a href="#Part-4-The-challenges-of-making-solo-podcasting" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

There’s no one to take over if you fall behind schedule or have a day off. Being a solo podcast host takes a lot of time and energy, and you don’t get a choice.</p><p>Even if you manage to pull it off, some people don’t like your podcast and have nothing but negative things to say about you. Preparing for this every time you create a new episode would be best. Therefore You need to have someone to take over when you fall.</p><h3 id="Harder-to-stay-motivated"><a href="#Harder-to-stay-motivated" class="headerlink" title="Harder to stay motivated"></a>Harder to stay motivated</h3><p>The problem with solo podcasts is that there is no built-in motivation. You must do it because you enjoy it or hope it will help someone else. There’s no intrinsic reason to do it. That said, the biggest problem with making solo podcasts is that it becomes harder and harder to stay motivated to keep making episodes.</p><h3 id="Harder-to-deliver-a-Montage"><a href="#Harder-to-deliver-a-Montage" class="headerlink" title="Harder to deliver a Montage"></a>Harder to deliver a Montage</h3><p>If your podcast is mostly monologue or narration, and you don’t do any interviews or interviews with yourself, you will feel like a hamster in a wheel with no release.</p><p>To deliver a montage effectively, you must first create a soundtrack of voiceover audio in your mind. It would be best to hear it repeatedly until you’ve committed the track to memory. Once you have that, you must record the monologue audio and edit it into a montage.</p><h2 id="Part-5-The-Best-10-Solo-Podcasts-Examples"><a href="#Part-5-The-Best-10-Solo-Podcasts-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

It’s a chance to express yourself, a platform to share your ideas and thoughts with people. Also, to show people who you are and what you’re about—the beauty of solo podcasting. You are free, and it’s a great feeling. The idea is simple: You are the protagonist of your own story.</p><h3 id="Go-at-your-own-pace-1"><a href="#Go-at-your-own-pace-1" class="headerlink" title="Go at your own pace"></a>Go at your own pace</h3><p>Working on your own gives flexibility with working hours you wouldn’t get as part of a team. That means you can work at your own pace and not feel pressured by a deadline or fear failing since knowing no one but yourself is listening.</p><p>It also means you can work at your own pace as a podcast host without waiting for your audience to be ready.</p><h3 id="Content-is-totally-under-your-control-1"><a href="#Content-is-totally-under-your-control-1" class="headerlink" title="Content is totally under your control"></a>Content is totally under your control</h3><p>You’re always controlling your content while working in a solo podcaster scenario. No one else tells you what to say; no one tells you how to say it.</p><p>The upside is that you don’t have to worry about getting your ideas “out there,” which allows you to be creative.No but yourself can dictate the tone of your show.</p><p>Solo podcasters don’t have anyone else to compete with, and they get to choose what they talk about.

Therefore it’s important to have some roadmap for your episode before you even begin working on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/solo-podcasting-3.jpg"                      alt="podcast outline"                ></p><p>An outline for a good episode usually includes an introduction&#x2F;promo, the main topic, a break, a conclusion, and a wrap-up. It helps you understand the topic you want to cover.</p><p>If you don’t have a clear idea of what you want to talk about, you will have trouble following along when you sit down to record. Just be careful not to repeat yourself too much. Don’t try and cover every single aspect of your topic.</p><h3 id="A-hook-for-the-episode-beginning-1"><a href="#A-hook-for-the-episode-beginning-1" class="headerlink" title="A hook for the episode beginning"></a>A hook for the episode beginning</h3><p>The hook is the first thing that draws the listener in and sets up the rest of the content. What is it about your show that makes people want to listen? Your hook should always be unique, but a little commonality doesn’t hurt.</p><p>If you’re struggling to come up with a hook for an episode of your podcast, here are a few ideas for you to consider:</p><ul><li>What topic do you enjoy talking about?</li><li>What do you want to learn about?</li><li>Is there something, in particular, you’re interested in?</li></ul><h3 id="Mind-the-length-of-your-solo-podcast-1"><a href="#Mind-the-length-of-your-solo-podcast-1" class="headerlink" title="Mind the length of your solo podcast"></a>Mind the length of your solo podcast</h3><p>Length is everything. Podcasting is about the length of your content, and you will struggle if you have a short episode. You need at least 30 minutes of material for your episode, or you risk alienating listeners and driving them away from your brand.</p><p>You’ll lose listeners’ attention if you don’t know what to say during your episode. So instead, think of your podcast as a mini-publication. You can get away with making shorter episodes because you can fill more content into your episodes.</p><h3 id="Recap-the-episode-1"><a href="#Recap-the-episode-1" class="headerlink" title="Recap the episode"></a>Recap the episode</h3><p>Recapping the previous episode is a great way to start your podcast.

The FAA predicts that by the year 2020, a massive seven million drones could be sold in the U.S. alone; that’s about two and a half times the entire population of Nevada!</p><p>When it comes to buying a drone, the undisputed drone king right now is, without a doubt, Chinese company <a class="link"   href="https://www.dji.com/" >DJI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Having achieved amazing success with the highly portable Mavic Pro in 2016, and with the pocket rocket DJI Spark last year, the world held its breath to see what was coming next.</p><p>What did come next was something truly amazing; perhaps a real game changer. Neatly squeezing in the middle of their two highly successful products came the brand-new Mavic Air; a quadcopter that is highly portable, incredibly powerful and, dare we say it, a little bit sexier than its predecessors. But does it live up to the promise, and how does it compare with the amazingly popular, entry level DJI Spark?</p><p>If you’re looking for easy portability, the DJI Spark is smaller and lighter but can’t be folded. When you collapse the arms on the Mavic Air, it’s compact and easy to stow, making it far more transportable than many of its predecessors.</p><p>If performance is key for you, it’s crucial to know that the Mavic Air will offer you a longer flight time by a substantial five minutes and is also faster by around 18.4km per hour, compared to the Spark. In addition to this, the range of the Mavic Air is a massive 50 per cent further than the Spark, at a huge 4km compared to 2km.</p><p>In terms of photographic capabilities, both drones offer some pretty good specs. However, the DJI Mavic Air outpaces the smaller Spark in terms of image quality, topping out at 100mbps compared to 24mbps and recording in up to 4K definition at 12MP. The Spark is configured to run at 1080p only. Both models offer obstacle avoidance and have numerous features, but on almost every specification, the Mavic Air seems to do just a little bit better.</p><p>So, is the more expensive DJI Mavic Air really worth the extra investment? With a price tag in the region of $400 to $700 more than that of the Spark packages, it’s a question well worth considering.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="From-Amateurs-to-Pros-Step-by-Step-Guide-on-Mastering-Background-Erasing-in-Adobe-Photoshop"><a href="#From-Amateurs-to-Pros-Step-by-Step-Guide-on-Mastering-Background-Erasing-in-Adobe-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="From Amateurs to Pros: Step-by-Step Guide on Mastering Background Erasing in Adobe Photoshop"></a>From Amateurs to Pros: Step-by-Step Guide on Mastering Background Erasing in Adobe Photoshop</h2><p>The Background Eraser Tool in Photoshop is a utility. It allows you to remove unwanted backgrounds or objects from an image, change its color, or even create a mask. But many users need help using the Background Eraser tool for their pictures.</p><p>To simplify things, we’ll provide basic information about the eraser tools in Photoshop.</p><p>So, if you are ready to learn how to use the Background Eraser tool in Photoshop, let’s dig in!</p><h2 id="Basic-Information-About-Eraser-Tools-In-Photoshop"><a href="#Basic-Information-About-Eraser-Tools-In-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Basic Information About Eraser Tools In Photoshop"></a>Basic Information About Eraser Tools In Photoshop</h2><p>The <strong>eraser tools in Photoshop</strong> can be used to create transparent backgrounds or to remove unwanted background elements from an image. These tools work by sampling the color of the pixels in the image and then erasing pixels that match the sampled color.</p><p>There are three main variations of eraser tools in Photoshop:</p><ul><li>Eraser</li><li>Background Eraser</li><li>Magic Eraser</li></ul><p>Many people need clarification with Photoshop’s Background Eraser and Magic Eraser tools. Therefore, we’ve discussed their similarities and dissimilarities. You can understand them better and so that you can prefer the one that suits your needs:</p><h3 id="Similarities"><a href="#Similarities" class="headerlink" title="Similarities"></a>Similarities</h3><p>The following are the similarities between the Background Eraser and Magic Eraser Tools:</p><p><strong>Erase Pixels Based On Colors:</strong> The Background Eraser tool and Magic Eraser tool can erase pixels based on their color. This means you can select a color, and the tool will erase all the related pixels.</p><p><strong>Destructive Tools:</strong> Both the Background Eraser and Magic Eraser are destructive tools in nature. They delete the pixels you erase. Therefore, you cannot undo or redo your changes once you’ve used either of these tools. However, there are some non-native workarounds to restore your images.</p><h3 id="Dissimilarities"><a href="#Dissimilarities" class="headerlink" title="Dissimilarities"></a>Dissimilarities</h3><p>Here are some dissimilarities between the Background Eraser and Magic Eraser Tools:</p><p><strong>Usage</strong>: To use the Background Eraser tool, you have to hover over the area in your image to erase it based on the pixels you paint over. On the other hand, the Magic Eraser tool instantly erases similar pixels based on your selected color.</p><p><strong>Adjustment Settings</strong>: The Background Eraser offers more adjustment tools than the Magic Eraser. For instance, the former offers Sampling, Limits, Brush size, Tolerance, Angle, and Protect Foreground Color settings, while the latter includes Tolerance, Anto-alias, Contiguous, Sample All Layers, and Opacity options.</p><p>Each tool’s diversity in options significantly affects the final image’s quality. For example, the Magic Eraser Tool erases areas rapidly, though there is limited control over which pixels are deleted.</p><h2 id="Background-Of-Eraser-Tools-Settings-Before-The-Tutorial"><a href="#Background-Of-Eraser-Tools-Settings-Before-The-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Background Of Eraser Tools Settings Before The Tutorial"></a>Background Of Eraser Tools Settings Before The Tutorial</h2><p>Before starting our tutorial on <strong>how to use the Background Eraser tool in Photoshop,</strong> let’s first discuss the adjustment options enabled when selecting the tool and working with them. In this way, you can better understand the steps in the guidance.</p><h3 id="1-Brush-Preset-Picker"><a href="#1-Brush-Preset-Picker" class="headerlink" title="1. Brush Preset Picker"></a>1. Brush Preset Picker</h3><p>When you enable the Background Eraser tool in Photoshop, you will see that the cursor changes to a brush, indicating that this tool works like other <strong>“Brush Tools.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/bruch-preset-picker-function-in-background-eraser-tool.png"                      alt="bruch preset picker function in background eraser tool"                ></p><p>The <strong>Brush Preset Picker</strong> is the first option that opens up a panel to let you adjust the size of your brush, its hardness, spacing, and tolerance. You can also change the size using the <strong>Left Bracket ( [ )</strong> and <strong>Right Bracket ( ] )</strong>  keys on your PC keyboard.</p><p>To adjust the hardness, press the <strong>“Shift+ Left Bracket”</strong> or <strong>“Shift+Right Bracket”</strong> keys. We recommend that you set it to <strong>100%</strong> when erasing the pixels from your image.</p><h3 id="2-Sampling-Options"><a href="#2-Sampling-Options" class="headerlink" title="2. Sampling Options"></a>2. Sampling Options</h3><p>In the Background Eraser tool’s <strong>Options bar,</strong> you will find the <strong>“Sampling Options”</strong> that includes three different icons with different behaviors:</p><p><strong>Continuous</strong>: This option is selected by default and works best on an image with a colorful background because it removes different pixels as you drag your brush around your picture.</p><p><strong>Once</strong>: If your image’s background does not have many colors, this setting will work best. This is because it removes a single pixel at a time.</p><p><strong>Background Swatch</strong>: You may sometimes have difficulty positioning the crosshair tool precisely over the color you wish to erase. To prevent this, you can use the Background Swatch Option that helps you pick a color and will only erase the activated color from the BG.</p><h3 id="3-Limits"><a href="#3-Limits" class="headerlink" title="3. Limits"></a>3. Limits</h3><p>After you pick a color to erase, the Limits function identifies the location of the pixels that match that color, making it easier for you to erase them precisely.</p><p>The Limit function comes with three options:</p><p><strong>Contiguous:</strong> It’s a default option that erases pixels of the same color touched by the crosshair, which means that it won’t remove any isolated area of pixels located in other image elements.</p><p><strong>Discontiguous:</strong> When you enable the Discontiguous option, Photoshop can erase any pixels in the image that match the sampled color, regardless of whether or not they are touching the crosshair.</p><p><strong>Find Edges:</strong> This setting will come in handy when you find that the edges around your subject are not sharp enough. The Find Edges option works more precisely than the Contiguous and helps to smooth down the sides.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/limits-function-in-background-eraser-tool.png"                      alt="limits function in background eraser tool"                ></p><h3 id="4-Tolerance"><a href="#4-Tolerance" class="headerlink" title="4. Tolerance"></a>4. Tolerance</h3><p>Located directly to the right of the Limits function, Tolerance is one of the most important options in Background Eraser, as it signifies how much a pixel’s shade can vary from the sampled color for Photoshop to erase it.</p><p>By default, the Tolerance’s value is set to <strong>50%</strong>. But you should attempt a lower Tolerance setting if your background color is somewhat similar to the subject and Photoshop erases its parts while removing the background.</p><p>If, however, the background color is fringing around the subject, use a higher Tolerance value.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/tolerance-function-in-background-eraser-tool.png"                      alt="tolerance function in background eraser tool"                ></p><h3 id="5-Brush-Angle"><a href="#5-Brush-Angle" class="headerlink" title="5. Brush Angle"></a>5. Brush Angle</h3><p>The Brush Angle option can help you adjust the angle of your crosshair to quickly erase the pixels in difficult-to-reach areas in your image’s background. You can also hit the <strong>“R”</strong> key on your keyboard to rotate the canvas.</p><h3 id="6-Protect-Foreground-Color"><a href="#6-Protect-Foreground-Color" class="headerlink" title="6. Protect Foreground Color"></a>6. Protect Foreground Color</h3><p>Sometimes, Photoshop erases parts of your subject while removing the background, no matter what Tolerance value you use. To avoid this, the Protected Foreground Color option in the Options bar can come in handy.</p><p>This option allows you to choose a color from your subject as a foreground color, and Photoshop will stop erasing it while you drag the brush over the image to remove the background.</p><h3 id="7-Pen-Pressure"><a href="#7-Pen-Pressure" class="headerlink" title="7. Pen Pressure"></a>7. Pen Pressure</h3><p>Pen Pressure is helpful if you use a drawing tablet instead of a mouse. With this option selected, the crosshair opacity will be regulated based on the pressure applied with your pen on the tablet.</p><h2 id="How-To-Use-Background-Eraser-Tool-To-Erase-An-Image-Background"><a href="#How-To-Use-Background-Eraser-Tool-To-Erase-An-Image-Background" class="headerlink" title="How To Use Background Eraser Tool To Erase An Image Background?"></a>How To Use Background Eraser Tool To Erase An Image Background?</h2><p>The following steps will help you learn how to erase your image background using Photoshop’s Background Eraser tool.</p><p>Step1 In the first step, launch <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html"><strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong></a> on your PC and import your image. Then, select the <strong>Background Eraser Tool</strong> in the Toolbar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/using-the-background-eraser-tool-in-photoshop.png"                      alt="using the background eraser tool in photoshop"                ></p><p>Step2 Now, click and drag over the background area you want to erase. Photoshop will automatically select the area you want to erase as you drag.</p><p>Adjust the size and hardness of the eraser brush by using the <strong>Brush Preset Picker</strong> in the <strong>Options bar.</strong> Alternatively, you can also press the <strong>“Right Bracket (]) “</strong> button to increase the size of the brush and the <strong>“Left Bracket ([)”</strong> key to decrease it.</p><p>Step3 In the next step, set the <strong>“Sampling Options”</strong> to <strong>“Once”</strong> and <strong>“Limits”</strong> to <strong>“Contiguous.”</strong> This will help you avoid erasing the wrong pixel color and remove those positioned closer to each other.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/setting-the-sampling-options-and-limits-in-background-eraser-tool.png"                      alt="setting the sampling options and limits in background eraser tool"                ></p><p>However, if the pixels are positioned far apart from each other, you can set the <strong>“Limit”</strong> option to <strong>“Discontiguous.”</strong> While when erasing the pixels around the subject, set the <strong>“Limits”</strong> settings to <strong>“Find Edges”</strong> to ensure smooth edges.</p><p>Step4 If your image background and subject are of the same color and <strong>Photoshop</strong> it removing parts of your subject during the process, set the <strong>Tolerance</strong> to a <strong>low value</strong> by dragging its slider up or down or typing it in the box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/setting-the-tolerance-value-in-background-eraser-tool.png"                      alt="setting the tolerance value in background eraser tool"                ></p><p>Step5 When removing pixels from a background, you can preserve specific pixel colors from being removed, which can be helpful if they are close to the area you want to erase.</p><p>For this, place the cursor on the color you want to keep and press &amp; hold the <strong>ALT</strong> (Windows) or the <strong>Option</strong> key (Mac) until the brush changes to the Eyedropper Tool icon. Then, click the area to sample the color in the <strong>Foreground Swatch.</strong></p><p>This will protect the color, and Photoshop will now avoid erasing it while removing the background. You can repeat the process to preserve other pixels while removing the background.</p><p>Step6 Finally, after removing the background, you can place the subject on another image, a solid color, or export it as PNG with transparent BG.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/exporting-the-final-image-after-erasing-background-with-background-eraser.png"                      alt="exporting the final image after erasing background with background eraser"                ></p><h2 id="You-May-Want-to-Know-The-Working-Process-of-Background-Eraser-Tool"><a href="#You-May-Want-to-Know-The-Working-Process-of-Background-Eraser-Tool" class="headerlink" title="You May Want to Know: The Working Process of Background Eraser Tool"></a>You May Want to Know: The Working Process of Background Eraser Tool</h2><p>Now that you’ve learned <strong>how to use the Background Eraser Tool in Photoshop.</strong> During the process of operating, you might wonder how the software works and changes the BG layer.</p><p>To help you understand this process, we’ll create a sample project (image with pink and blue strips) and show you how the tool works:</p><p>After importing the image, when we check the <strong>“Layers”</strong> panel, we can see that the image is labeled as a <strong>“Background”</strong> layer. So now, we want to erase the pink column and keep the blue one to create a pattern.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/checking-the-image-layer-in-the-layers-panel.png"                      alt="checking the image layer in the layers panel"                ></p><p>When we select the Background Erase tool, the cursor changes to a brush that helps Photoshop to sample the colors that come under the <strong>crosshair (Plus)</strong> in the center of the circle. The circle around the crosshair shows the area where the software will erase the pixels (only the pixels with the same color or shades).</p><p>Now, to remove the pink stripes, we’ll move the brush to that part, and when clicked, the area under the circle will be erased. Notice that even if the circle moves to the blue area, it remains untouched because those pixels are not the same shade&#x2F;color.</p><p>Therefore, as long as we keep the crosshair within the pink area, Photoshop will only erase the pink pixels.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/checking-the-working-process-of-photo-shop.png"                      alt="checking the working process of photo shop"                ></p><p>However, if we accidentally erase the blue stripes, we can always go back by simply pressing the <strong>“CTRL+Z”</strong> in Windows and <strong>“Command+Z”</strong> in Mac. To undo multiple steps, hit the <strong>“Ctrl+Alt+Z” (Windows)</strong> or <strong>Command+Option+Z” (Mac)</strong> keys repeatedly.</p><h2 id="Common-FAQs-When-Using-Background-Esarser-Tool-in-Photoshop"><a href="#Common-FAQs-When-Using-Background-Esarser-Tool-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Common FAQs When Using Background Esarser Tool in Photoshop"></a>Common FAQs When Using Background Esarser Tool in Photoshop</h2><h3 id="1-Why-Is-Photoshop-Eraser-Tool-Not-Accessible"><a href="#1-Why-Is-Photoshop-Eraser-Tool-Not-Accessible" class="headerlink" title="1.

Think about how frequently videos appear on your Twitter feed or Facebook Timeline. How often do you get emails with videos? Video may be easily and quickly shared widely.</p><p><strong>You don’t require a huge budget</strong></p><p>While hiring pros to make various sorts of videos has significant advantages, not all videos require a six-figure budget. With only a few pieces of essential video equipment, you may quickly and easily produce influential movies of lectures, demonstrations, and more.</p><p><strong>Mobile-Friendly Video</strong></p><p>Given how many students have smartphones, video is an excellent medium for connecting with them. Most students already use YouTube, which is particularly adapted for mobile devices.</p><p><strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong> Best YouTube Video Maker to Create Vlogs with Transitions and Effects.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/box-filmora-x.png"                                     > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-9-square.svg"                                     ></p><h2 id="How-to-See-Liked-Comments-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-See-Liked-Comments-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to See Liked Comments on YouTube?"></a>How to See Liked Comments on YouTube?</h2><p>YouTube is a service that is available for free, and it may be a terrific place for teenagers to find interest.

For example, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandates all member states to harmonize their data privacy laws. In addition, it requires organizations to issue you a privacy notice that is transparent, concise, and easily accessible. Unfortunately, companies like Facebook continue to face criticism for breaching these laws through features like Off Facebook Previews.</p><p>If you are unfamiliar with the feature, the following information is extremely useful. As you keep reading, you will discover what “off Facebook preview” is and how it affects your data protection. Furthermore, there is a detailed guide on how to deactivate the feature in your account.</p><h2 id="Part1-What-is-Off-Facebook-Preview"><a href="#Part1-What-is-Off-Facebook-Preview" class="headerlink" title="Part1: What is Off-Facebook Preview?"></a>Part1: What is Off-Facebook Preview?</h2><p>Off-Facebook Previews are a record of all your activities outside the platform. Different companies offer this information to Facebook using their business tools, such as App Events, Offline Conversions, and Meta Pixel.</p><p>So, what information does the Off-Facebook Previews capture? According to Facebook, the feature allows them to collect:</p><ul><li>The number of times you open their client’s app on your device.</li><li>Your shopping cart history.</li><li>Your search history. For example, your local retailer can submit your search history to Facebook if their website uses some of their technology to run it.</li><li>A record of all apps and websites where you use your Facebook credentials to log in. Typically, the information comes from companies offering Facebook Login as one of their single sign-on (SSO) methods.</li><li>Your donation and content viewing activity from companies that use Facebook API in their websites and apps.</li></ul><h2 id="Part2-Should-I-Leave-Off-Facebook-Activity-be-on-or-off"><a href="#Part2-Should-I-Leave-Off-Facebook-Activity-be-on-or-off" class="headerlink" title="Part2: Should I Leave Off Facebook Activity be on or off?"></a>Part2: Should I Leave Off Facebook Activity be on or off?</h2><p>As you can see, Off Facebook Previews collects lots of your sensitive information from its clients. Therefore, you must manage how much you share with other companies when not using the social media platform directly. The following sections help you understand how you can protect your data better.</p><h3 id="1-How-to-switch-it-off"><a href="#1-How-to-switch-it-off" class="headerlink" title="1.

In addition, it further emphasizes this through its Privacy Policy, and the <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/off%5Ffacebook%5Factivity" >What is off-Facebook activity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li>In addition, the company strictly prohibits its clients from sharing sensitive information through the Off-Facebook Previews feature. Some of the sensitive information it prohibits includes your medical history, financial information, birthday, and user credentials.</li><li>Furthermore, any organization using Facebook’s business tools must clearly state this information with their clients before activating their subscription. Failure to do so can lead to immediate service discontinuation or legal liability in extreme cases.</li><li>Moreover, the company allows you to manage your Off-Facebook activity directly from your profile. For example, you can use the Clear Previous activity option to erase all previous data or use the Disconnect Future activity function to prevent further data collection.</li><li>Finally, the company openly shares a record of the information it receives from its clients through the <strong>Recent Activity</strong> Please refer to the <strong>What is Off-Facebook Preview</strong> section to discover what user information the company shares in your recent activity report.</li></ul><h2 id="FAQs"><a href="#FAQs" class="headerlink" title="FAQs"></a>FAQs</h2><h4 id="Is-the-Off-Facebook-Previews-feature-safe"><a href="#Is-the-Off-Facebook-Previews-feature-safe" class="headerlink" title="Is the Off-Facebook Previews feature safe?"></a>Is the Off-Facebook Previews feature safe?</h4><p>Not in its current state. Here are some of the reasons for this stance.</p><ul><li>It takes 48 hours for Facebook to disconnect you from the service fully. This gives them ample time to collect more personal information from you to further their business interests.</li><li>You will continue receiving ads from Facebook clients even when you deactivate the feature successfully. This is because the social media platform continues to collect your personal data if your account is active. For example, third-party advertisers can show you campaigns based on your Facebook group likes and interests.</li><li>You will need to create a new account for apps and websites where you used Facebook SSO. This is because disabling Off-Facebook Previews automatically signs you out from these accounts.</li><li>Despite several punishments from law enforcement, Facebook continues to face criticism for its poor data security protocols. For example, the company is issuing checks of up to $397 to its users, following an <a class="link"   href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/did-you-receive-a-illinois-facebook-settlement-check-in-the-mail-heres-why-and-what-to-know-about-it/2839499/" >agreement with the Illinois State Settlement Administrator for data privacy violations. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h4 id="Can-you-deactivate-Off-Facebook-Previews-for-specific-websites-and-apps"><a href="#Can-you-deactivate-Off-Facebook-Previews-for-specific-websites-and-apps" class="headerlink" title="Can you deactivate Off-Facebook Previews for specific websites and apps?"></a>Can you deactivate Off-Facebook Previews for specific websites and apps?</h4><p>Yes, you can disable your future off-Facebook activity for specific apps. Here is how you do it:</p><ol><li>Log in to your Facebook account, and choose <strong>Settings and Privacy</strong> from your profile picture drop-down menu.</li><li>Tap on the <strong>Settings</strong> option, and choose <strong>Privacy</strong> from the resulting menu.</li><li>Then, select the <strong>Off-Facebook Activity</strong>, followed by <strong>Explore Activity</strong>, on the next page.</li><li>Finalize the process by clicking the <strong>Select Future Activity to Disconnect</strong> button.</li></ol><h4 id="Do-you-need-to-repeat-the-process-for-different-platform-devices"><a href="#Do-you-need-to-repeat-the-process-for-different-platform-devices" class="headerlink" title="Do you need to repeat the process for different platform devices?"></a>Do you need to repeat the process for different platform devices?</h4><p>No. Facebook is a cross-platform program, meaning the changes apply to all devices you have access to. So, for example, Off-Facebook Previews will still be inactive on your desktop even when you make the change using your smartphone.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/breakdown-of-cloud-storage-pricing-expert-analysis-and-top-deals-for-2024/"><u>Breakdown of Cloud Storage Pricing  Expert Analysis & Top Deals for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-top-10-premium-luts-available-for-free/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Top 10 Premium LUTs, Available for FREE</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-revolutionizing-classic-images-a-guide-to-enhancing-vhs-photos-on-pcs/"><u>[Updated] Revolutionizing Classic Images  A Guide to Enhancing VHS Photos on PCs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-iphone-guide-inverting-your-media-files/"><u>[Updated] IPhone Guide  Inverting Your Media Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-a-guide-to-designing-spectacular-photo-tileworks/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, A Guide to Designing Spectacular Photo Tileworks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-enhancing-presentations-with-powerpoints-speech-recognition-tool-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Enhancing Presentations with PowerPoint's Speech Recognition Tool for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-7-exceptional-drone-gimbals-unveiled/"><u>[New] In 2024, 7 Exceptional Drone Gimbals Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-optimizing-your-chromebooks-zoom-capabilities-for-2024/"><u>[New] Optimizing Your Chromebook's Zoom Capabilities for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/fix-oneplus-ace-2v-android-system-webview-crash-2024-issue-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Fix OnePlus Ace 2V Android System Webview Crash 2024 Issue | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-optimizing-group-chats-with-google-meets-filtering-options/"><u>In 2024, Optimizing Group Chats with Google Meet's Filtering Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-poco-c55-pin-codepattern-lockpassword-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Unlock Poco C55 PIN Code/Pattern Lock/Password</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/accessibility-achieved-the-simple-setup-of-ifunny-app/"><u>Accessibility Achieved  The Simple Setup of iFunny App</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-stolen-apple-iphone-11-pro-in-different-conditionsin-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How To Unlock Stolen Apple iPhone 11 Pro In Different Conditionsin | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-the-art-of-screen-recording-top-4-techniques-for-hp-users/"><u>[Updated] Mastering the Art of Screen Recording  Top 4 Techniques for HP Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-revamping-your-virtual-self-on-tiktok-for-2024/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Revamping Your Virtual Self on TikTok for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-high-end-methods-for-monitoring-and-recording-pc-sounds/"><u>[Updated] High-End Methods for Monitoring and Recording PC Sounds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-elevate-your-social-score-best-tools-for-post-and-engagement-for-2024/"><u>[New] Elevate Your Social Score  Best Tools for Post and Engagement for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Although the reasons vary between users, here are the main ones.</p><h4 id="1-It-is-slow"><a href="#1-It-is-slow" class="headerlink" title="1. It is slow"></a><strong>1. It is slow</strong></h4><p>The Photos app is not a fast photo viewer for Windows 10. Regardless of your computer’s specs, it takes approximately similar load times across all machines. Here are some of the reasons for this flaw:</p><ul><li>Photos take between 10 and 20 seconds to load because the program needs to check if you are connected to your One Drive account.</li><li>Accessing the app through your <strong>File Explorer menu</strong> will alsotake you a while, especially if you have other app extensions on the list.

For example, image viewer Windows 10 lets you download multiple images with a single click.</p><p>However, that is about as much you can get when using the program compared to the dozens of photo enhancements you can do with other similar software.??</p><h4 id="3-Program-crash-galore"><a href="#3-Program-crash-galore" class="headerlink" title="3.

The application crashes nearly every step of the photo viewing process. For example, it is common for your photo to freeze when saving your edits. As such, you have to restart the program and redo the adjustments.</p><h4 id="4-Horrible-user-experience"><a href="#4-Horrible-user-experience" class="headerlink" title="4.

How can you switch from photo viewer for Windows 10 to your preferred software?</h4><p>Access the <strong>Default Apps</strong> menu from the <strong>Settings</strong> option of your OS. Then, change your preferred app by selecting it from the <strong>Photos</strong> menu.</p><p>Part1: Why Windows 10 photos is not a good choice?</p><p>There are plenty of reasons why relying on Windows 10 photos for your creative work is a bad idea. Although the reasons vary between users, here are the main ones.</p><h4 id="1-It-is-slow-1"><a href="#1-It-is-slow-1" class="headerlink" title="1. It is slow"></a><strong>1. It is slow</strong></h4><p>The Photos app is not a fast photo viewer for Windows 10. Regardless of your computer’s specs, it takes approximately similar load times across all machines. Here are some of the reasons for this flaw:</p><ul><li>Photos take between 10 and 20 seconds to load because the program needs to check if you are connected to your One Drive account.</li><li>Accessing the app through your <strong>File Explorer menu</strong> will alsotake you a while, especially if you have other app extensions on the list. For example, if you have Windows 10 Photo viewer and MS Publisher active on the menu, Photo Viewer for Windows 10 takes a backseat.</li></ul><h4 id="2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process-1"><a href="#2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process-1" class="headerlink" title="2. It is bad at batch process"></a><strong>2. It is bad at batch process</strong></h4><p>For the amateur photographers reading this, photo batch processing is when you edit multiple pictures simultaneously. For example, image viewer Windows 10 lets you download multiple images with a single click.</p><p>However, that is about as much you can get when using the program compared to the dozens of photo enhancements you can do with other similar software.??</p><h4 id="3-Program-crash-galore-1"><a href="#3-Program-crash-galore-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Program crash galore"></a><strong>3. Program crash galore</strong></h4><p>It is fine for computer software to crash occasionally. However, Windows 10 Photo Viewer takes it to the next level. The application crashes nearly every step of the photo viewing process. For example, it is common for your photo to freeze when saving your edits. As such, you have to restart the program and redo the adjustments.</p><h4 id="4-Horrible-user-experience-1"><a href="#4-Horrible-user-experience-1" class="headerlink" title="4.

Detailed Review for Easy HDR"></a>Part 2. Detailed Review for Easy HDR</h2><p>Before diving deeper into the detailed Easy HDR features, it’s important to note that the program has a demo version. You can use this version to practice and study the vital components of easyHDR. But be guided that the demo version exports images with a watermark. In addition, users can’t save HDRi in TIFF format. Let’s get in!</p><ol><li><strong>High-Quality Bracket Merging</strong></li></ol><p>A good quality HDRi software should easily merge different image exposures, making the photo look natural and spectacular. To start incorporating, drag the image brackets to easyHDR and press “Ok” on the pop-up screen. You can now try the different bracket merging effects until you find something that suits your preference.</p><ol><li><strong>Editing features</strong></li></ol><p>EasyHDR goes a step further to provide its users with a comprehensive list of editing features. For example, the “Clone Stamp” tool can remove unwanted objects like cables without blurring the photo. You can also use the “Tone Curve” feature to adjust the brightness of shadows and highlights.</p><ol><li><strong>Ghost removal</strong></li></ol><p>No, this is not the scary ghost that you know. Instead, these ghosting artefacts appear in misaligned photos due to moving objects like leaves, branches, cars, people, etc. With Easy HDR, you can eliminate the “ghosts” manually or automatically. Simply open the photo and turn on “Ghost Removal” to remove them automatically.</p><ol><li><strong>HDR batch processing</strong></li></ol><p>As expected, you can find it pretty tedious to import and merge each HDR bracket individually. For this reason, easyHDR comes with a “Batch Processing” feature that allows users to combine a whole folder of brackets automatically.</p><ol><li><strong>LDR enhancement</strong></li></ol><p>Although we’ve mainly focused on brackets and photos in this post, it’s important to note that easyHDR also works with single images.

Select the New option and set parameters for your document, according to the space the text is going to occupy in its intended medium. In the Name field, type a name. You can also decide to leave the Photoshop default.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/text-distortion-1.png"                      alt="text distortion in photo"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2\"></a>Step 2\</h3><p>Click the Window menu to open the Layers panel and click Layers.</p><h3 id="Step-3"><a href="#Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3\"></a>Step 3\</h3><p>Click on the New Layer icon that resembles a bent-corner sticky note.</p><h3 id="Step-4"><a href="#Step-4" class="headerlink" title="Step 4\"></a>Step 4\</h3><p>Click on the T icon located in the Tools panel. You can also click on the Window and select Tools if you don’t see the Tools panel. After opening the Type toolbar, choose the text size, color, and font you’ll use for the distorted text. Now, click the canvas, and then type the text you want to distort. The text appears in a non-distorted format when you type.</p><h3 id="Step-5"><a href="#Step-5" class="headerlink" title="Step 5\"></a>Step 5\</h3><p>Check the list and right-click on the new text layer with a T icon symbol and the words you have typed. Select the Rasterize Layer option; this will turn the box with the T icon into a white and gray checkerboard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/text-distortion-2.png"                      alt="how to distort text in photo"                ></p><h3 id="Step-6"><a href="#Step-6" class="headerlink" title="Step 6\"></a>Step 6\</h3><p>Click on the Edit menu, then hover your cursor over Transform. From the fly-out menu, choose Distort. A border encircled with white boxes will surround the text on the canvas. Click and pull a corner box away from the text, like toward a corner of the Adobe Photoshop work area.</p><p>Be sure to pull it in different directions and check how the text will become funhouse-style elongated in different ways; this will allow you to judge which look you prefer for your text distortion.</p><h3 id="Step-7"><a href="#Step-7" class="headerlink" title="Step 7\"></a>Step 7\</h3><p>Now, click another corner and drag towards the center to make the text look like it’s slightly squished.</p><h3 id="Step-8"><a href="#Step-8" class="headerlink" title="Step 8\"></a>Step 8\</h3><p>Take one of the middleboxes and pull and drug them on either the bottom or top to make the text wider.</p><h3 id="Step-9"><a href="#Step-9" class="headerlink" title="Step 9\"></a>Step 9\</h3><p>Tinker around with different changes mentioned above until you get the text distortion you want. Once you are satisfied with the results, hit Enter to set the change and get rid of the boxes and borders from the text.</p><h3 id="Step-10"><a href="#Step-10" class="headerlink" title="Step 10\"></a>Step 10\</h3><p>Select the File menu and click Save As. Photoshop will automatically have “PSD” displayed in the Format box, which allows you to save your file as a proprietary Photoshop PSD. Make sure you leave this extension, as it lets you re-access the design layers and perform more text distortions in the future. Now, click on Save.</p><h3 id="Step-11"><a href="#Step-11" class="headerlink" title="Step 11\"></a>Step 11\</h3><p>Go to the File menu and click on it. Select the Save As option again. Choose your preferred graphic format and click Save. Photoshop will prompt you about discarding layers. When you see this, click OK or Yes. Doing this will render your text uneditable and allow anyone with an image viewer to open your graphic instead of only Photoshop. It will also allow you to include it in word processing documents, websites, and other materials.</p><h4 id="Add-Noise-to-the-Text"><a href="#Add-Noise-to-the-Text" class="headerlink" title="Add Noise to the Text"></a>Add Noise to the Text</h4><p>Select your text and then go to Filter - Noise - Add Noise; this will add Noise to the text.

You can apply text distortion to product logos, headers for a blog, or headers you would like to use in other marketing materials to make them stand out.</p><p>By typing normal characters and applying changes with a few clicks in the program, you will save yourself the time and money that you would have used in outsourcing custom designs.</p><p>The bottom line is: Distorting text in Photoshop is a simple process that requires patience and a little know-how. You can distort the text in many ways, making it a useful tool for creating various looks for your designs.</p><p>With that in mind, let’s look at how you can apply text distortion in photography using Photoshop.</p><h3 id="Step-1-3"><a href="#Step-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1\"></a>Step 1\</h3><p>Start Photoshop, and then click on the File menu. Select the New option and set parameters for your document, according to the space the text is going to occupy in its intended medium. In the Name field, type a name. You can also decide to leave the Photoshop default.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/text-distortion-1.png"                      alt="text distortion in photo"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-3"><a href="#Step-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2\"></a>Step 2\</h3><p>Click the Window menu to open the Layers panel and click Layers.</p><h3 id="Step-3-3"><a href="#Step-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3\"></a>Step 3\</h3><p>Click on the New Layer icon that resembles a bent-corner sticky note.</p><h3 id="Step-4-3"><a href="#Step-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 4\"></a>Step 4\</h3><p>Click on the T icon located in the Tools panel. You can also click on the Window and select Tools if you don’t see the Tools panel. After opening the Type toolbar, choose the text size, color, and font you’ll use for the distorted text. Now, click the canvas, and then type the text you want to distort. The text appears in a non-distorted format when you type.</p><h3 id="Step-5-3"><a href="#Step-5-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 5\"></a>Step 5\</h3><p>Check the list and right-click on the new text layer with a T icon symbol and the words you have typed. Select the Rasterize Layer option; this will turn the box with the T icon into a white and gray checkerboard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/text-distortion-2.png"                      alt="how to distort text in photo"                ></p><h3 id="Step-6-3"><a href="#Step-6-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 6\"></a>Step 6\</h3><p>Click on the Edit menu, then hover your cursor over Transform. From the fly-out menu, choose Distort. A border encircled with white boxes will surround the text on the canvas. Click and pull a corner box away from the text, like toward a corner of the Adobe Photoshop work area.</p><p>Be sure to pull it in different directions and check how the text will become funhouse-style elongated in different ways; this will allow you to judge which look you prefer for your text distortion.</p><h3 id="Step-7-3"><a href="#Step-7-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 7\"></a>Step 7\</h3><p>Now, click another corner and drag towards the center to make the text look like it’s slightly squished.</p><h3 id="Step-8-3"><a href="#Step-8-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 8\"></a>Step 8\</h3><p>Take one of the middleboxes and pull and drug them on either the bottom or top to make the text wider.</p><h3 id="Step-9-3"><a href="#Step-9-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 9\"></a>Step 9\</h3><p>Tinker around with different changes mentioned above until you get the text distortion you want. Once you are satisfied with the results, hit Enter to set the change and get rid of the boxes and borders from the text.</p><h3 id="Step-10-3"><a href="#Step-10-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 10\"></a>Step 10\</h3><p>Select the File menu and click Save As. Photoshop will automatically have “PSD” displayed in the Format box, which allows you to save your file as a proprietary Photoshop PSD. Make sure you leave this extension, as it lets you re-access the design layers and perform more text distortions in the future. Now, click on Save.</p><h3 id="Step-11-3"><a href="#Step-11-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 11\"></a>Step 11\</h3><p>Go to the File menu and click on it. Select the Save As option again. Choose your preferred graphic format and click Save. Photoshop will prompt you about discarding layers. When you see this, click OK or Yes. Doing this will render your text uneditable and allow anyone with an image viewer to open your graphic instead of only Photoshop. It will also allow you to include it in word processing documents, websites, and other materials.</p><h4 id="Add-Noise-to-the-Text-3"><a href="#Add-Noise-to-the-Text-3" class="headerlink" title="Add Noise to the Text"></a>Add Noise to the Text</h4><p>Select your text and then go to Filter - Noise - Add Noise; this will add Noise to the text.

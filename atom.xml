The Asus ProArtPA32U is a step in the same direction, as it is designed to look beautiful in any setting.</p><h4 id="1-Design-Style"><a href="#1-Design-Style" class="headerlink" title="1.Design Style"></a>1.Design Style</h4><p>This elegantly designed 32-inch 4K monitor is perfect for multi-image and split-screen displays. The true dimensions of the monitor haven’t yet been revealed by the manufacturer, but judging by its rather lengthy diagonal and thin bezels it is safe to say that the Asus ProArt PA32U will take quite a lot of desk space. The 4K HDR monitor will come with a strong stand that is capable of holding attachments and its seemingly heavy cabinet.</p><p>The ProArt32U will have a modern and sturdy look with thin bezels that work as a perfect frame for highly detailed images this 4K monitor is capable of displaying. More details regarding the PA32U’s visual appearance should become available as its release date approaches.</p><h4 id="2-Ports-and-Connectivity"><a href="#2-Ports-and-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="2.Ports and Connectivity"></a>2.Ports and Connectivity</h4><p>From the information available to the public it is clear that connectivity is an area in which the PA32U will shine. The HDMI and Display Port will be accompanied by the Thunderbolt 3 USB-C port and USB 3.1 Gen 2 hub that enable the Asus’ 4K HDR monitor to connect with a number of different devices. Such a wide array of connectivity options and a large number of ports will ensure that the monitor can meet the needs of the most demanding users.</p><h2 id="ASUS-PA32U-4K-HDR-Monitor-Features-and-Performance"><a href="#ASUS-PA32U-4K-HDR-Monitor-Features-and-Performance" class="headerlink" title="ASUS PA32U 4K HDR Monitor Features and Performance"></a>ASUS PA32U 4K HDR Monitor Features and Performance</h2><p>The PA32U will be one of the first 4K HDR monitors on the market and as such it will attract a lot of attention from high-end professionals who are in pursuit of the latest technology that can enable them to create breathtaking content.</p><h4 id="1-Display"><a href="#1-Display" class="headerlink" title="1.Display"></a>1.Display</h4><p>Although there is no official information yet, it is assumed that PA32U will have an IPS type panel accompanied by a quantum dot technology that will allow the brightness levels as high as 1000cd&#x2F;m2. Furthermore, the PA32U’s screen will have a backlight that features 384 LED zones and supports local dimming. The upcoming ProArt model will have a native 4K UHD resolution and a 16:9 aspect ratio. However, it is still unclear whether or not the refresh rate will remain as low as 60 Hz. The High Dynamic Range capability will significantly improve the monitor’s color range, which is very important for users who work with images. Perhaps the biggest downside of the Asus ProArt PA32U is the low pixel density because it is estimated that it will be as low as 138ppi.</p><h4 id="2-Image-quality"><a href="#2-Image-quality" class="headerlink" title="2.Image quality"></a>2.Image quality</h4><p>With a maximum resolution as high as 3840 X 2160 it is hard to imagine that the image quality on Asus ProArt PA32U will be anything short of amazing. To make things even better the manufacturer has announced that their forthcoming 4K HDR monitor will be capable of reproducing 85% of the Rec2020 color space, a feature that separates the forthcoming ProArt model from other 4K monitors in the similar price range.</p><p>Furthermore, the PA32U will have a 100% coverage of sRGB color gamut, 99.5% of the Adobe RGB color space and 95% of the DCI-PC3, which makes it a great choice for all users who need monitors capable of delivering beautiful and vivid colors. Unlike most monitors that store the color parameters on the PC, the PA32U can store color parameters locally on an IC chip of the monitor via the Asus ProArt calibration technology. The technology enables the users to adjust colors manually and connect the PA32U with different devices without having to re-calibrate the monitor. This feature is particularly important for those users who often work with both Mac OS and the Windows platforms.</p><p>Although, the Asus ProArt PA32U is obviously not a gaming monitor all signs point out that it would perform well with video games that have demanding graphics. The information about the monitor’s input lag and response time is still not made available to the public. The previous ProArt series models have struggled in this area, and it remains to be seen how much Asus will be able to improve in this aspect.</p><h4 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h4><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Although the official price of this 4K HDR monitor is still in the realm of speculation, most estimations place it in a $1700 - $2000 price range. This is a monitor designed for photo and video professionals who need a wide color gamut and highly detailed images and as such it is a perfect choice for users that can use the PA32U’s potential to its maximum. However, the users who would like to stream Netflix videos or play the latest video games can probably find a 4K monitor that is better suited for such purposes</p><p>Asus still hasn’t made the release date of their forthcoming addition to the ProArt series public, but the Asus ProArt PA32U is expected to hit the markets in the second half of 2017. However, the PA32U will be one of the best 4K HDR monitors on the market when it hits the market and it will be worth every penny of its market value.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-portraying-paradoxes-effects-for-time-travel-films/"><u>[Updated] Portraying Paradoxes  Effects for Time Travel Films</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-vital-social-spaces-maximizing-business-outreach-and-impact-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Vital Social Spaces Maximizing Business Outreach and Impact for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-pinnacle-of-vr-how-htc-vive-transforms-playtime/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  The Pinnacle of VR  How HTC Vive Transforms Playtime</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-guide-to-close-up-mastery-on-roblox/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Guide to Close-Up Mastery on Roblox</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-best-sources-for-pixel-ringtone-downloads-for-2024/"><u>[New] Best Sources for Pixel Ringtone Downloads for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-pro-tips-navigating-without-watching-edgenuity-content/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Pro Tips  Navigating Without Watching Edgenuity Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-top-picks-for-the-modern-buyer-advanced-360cams-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Top Picks for the Modern Buyer  Advanced 360Cams for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-tiktok-edits-unleashed-crafting-engaging-video-reactions-with-filmoras-pro-mode/"><u>[New] TikTok Edits Unleashed  Crafting Engaging Video Reactions with Filmora's Pro Mode</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-push-more-viewers-to-your-channel-with-easy-tricks-2/"><u>In 2024, Push More Viewers to Your Channel with Easy Tricks (2)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/revolutionizing-your-approach-to-iptv-viewership-saving/"><u>Revolutionizing Your Approach to IPTV Viewership Saving</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-ranking-creative-photo-and-video-shows-on-iphones-xr-i/"><u>[New] Ranking Creative Photo & Video Shows on iPhones (XR-I)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-blur-photo-backgrounds-for-free-top-online-editors/"><u>New In 2024, Blur Photo Backgrounds for Free Top Online Editors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-professional-audio-choice-the-ultimate-10-spotify-tools/"><u>In 2024, Professional Audio Choice  The Ultimate 10 Spotify Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-whatsapp-messages-on-poco-f5-5g-without-them-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Track WhatsApp Messages on Poco F5 5G Without Them Knowing? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-amazons-hot-list-tiktok-trends-you-cant-miss/"><u>In 2024, Amazon’s Hot List - TikTok Trends You Can't Miss</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Key-6-Social-Media-Outlets-for-Corporate-Growth"><a href="#Key-6-Social-Media-Outlets-for-Corporate-Growth" class="headerlink" title="Key 6 Social Media Outlets for Corporate Growth"></a>Key 6 Social Media Outlets for Corporate Growth</h2><p>Social media is a great way of promoting your business. With so many platforms, it can be hard to know which ones to use, so here’s a guide to some of the best social media platforms for business.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/business-social-media-platforms.jpg"                      alt="business social media platforms"                ></p><h2 id="TikTok"><a href="#TikTok" class="headerlink" title="TikTok"></a>TikTok</h2><p>TikTok is a video-sharing platform. It’s the most popular video-sharing platform in the world and has 30.8 Million daily active users. TikTok was founded by Zhang Yiming, who also founded Byte Dance, which owns TikTok. TikTok is based in Beijing, China, and was launched in September 2016.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/tiktok-app.jpg"                      alt="tiktok app"                ></p><p>It’s great for promoting your business with short, engaging videos. You can use TikTok to show off your products, give behind-the-scenes looks at your business, or even just tell your brand story. You can also use TikTok to run ads.</p><h2 id="Facebook"><a href="#Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Facebook"></a>Facebook</h2><p>Facebook currently has 1.908 billion daily active users, giving it a huge audience to reach customers. Facebook also has a lot of information about its users, which means they can target their ads more effectively than other platforms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/facebook-app.jpg"                      alt="facebook app"                ></p><p>Facebook’s advertising options are extensive and include Pros and Cons:</p><p>Advantages include being able to show your product at different stages in its lifecycle (e.g., pre-order vs. purchase); being able to target what kind of consumer you want; and having access to analytics that allow you to see how well your ads are performing (i.e., number of clicks&#x2F;impression).</p><p>Disadvantages include not knowing if people are going directly from clicking on an ad and buying something else online instead; not being able to tell if someone who saw an ad might have come back later to buy something from you instead, or spending too much money on ads without seeing results immediately (the latter is one reason why some businesses don’t like using Facebook as much).</p><h2 id="Twitter"><a href="#Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Twitter"></a>Twitter</h2><p>Twitter, the platform that started off as a way for people to share their thoughts up to 280 characters or less, has become much more than that. It is a great way to communicate with your customers and it can also help make your brand stand out. Twitter allows you to engage with potential customers and get feedback from them about what they think of your product or service.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/twitter-app.jpg"                      alt="twitter app"                ></p><p>If you want customer service feedback in real-time then Twitter is probably one of the best ways to do it because users are always on their phones looking at social media throughout the day. Also, Twitter is one of the easiest platforms to use so if someone needs help they can easily get it by tweeting someone who works there directly.</p><h2 id="YouTube"><a href="#YouTube" class="headerlink" title="YouTube"></a>YouTube</h2><p>There are plenty of reasons why YouTube is a great platform for business. Here are some of them:</p><p>You can create and share content. If you want to start sharing your knowledge with the world, then this is a good place to start. The only thing you need is a camera and an internet connection!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/youtube-app.jpg"                      alt="youtube app"                ></p><p>It’s a great place to connect with people who have similar interests as you do, or even just connect with people in general (if what they’re interested in has something to do with your field).</p><p>You can learn things too! There are tons of tutorials available on YouTube that will teach any skill imaginable - everything from learning how to play guitar or speak Spanish, all the way up through creating entire websites from scratch (which may be more than some people want). If there’s something specific that interests me personally then I know I’ll probably find it there somewhere because there are millions upon millions of videos uploaded every day by millions upon millions of different people worldwide.”</p><h2 id="Instagram"><a href="#Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Instagram"></a>Instagram</h2><p>Instagram is a visual platform, so it’s no surprise that it’s one of the best social media platforms for business. Not only can you use Instagram to promote your brand and products, but it also allows you to build customer engagement and build a community around your brand.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/instagram-app.jpg"                      alt="instagram app"                ></p><p>Instagram also has the advantage of being owned by Facebook, which means that you can easily transfer followers from Instagram onto Facebook.</p><h2 id="LinkedIn"><a href="#LinkedIn" class="headerlink" title="LinkedIn"></a>LinkedIn</h2><p>LinkedIn is a social media platform that is designed for business networking. It can be used to find customers, connect with industry thought leaders, and build relationships with other businesses.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/linkedin-app.jpg"                      alt="linkedin app"                ></p><p>LinkedIn is also a great place to post content, whether it’s articles, videos, or infographics. This is because LinkedIn users are generally more engaged than users of other social media platforms, and they’re more likely to read and share content that is interesting and relevant to their industry.</p><p>One disadvantage of LinkedIn is that it can be difficult to stand out from the crowd if you’re not a large or well-known company. This is because there are already so many businesses on LinkedIn, and many of them are already well-established.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>So, what’s the best social media platform for your business? I think the answer is different for everyone. The important thing is that you find out where your customers are and how they use social media.

It’s one of the world’s most extensive podcast streaming services. So how did it get there? And how can you get on the platform yourself?</p><p>This article dives deep into Apple’s podcast strategy. It includes how to submit to Apple Podcasts, why you should and how to improve your chances of getting on the platform.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Prepare-Your-Show-for-Apple-Podcast-Submission"><a href="#Part-1-Prepare-Your-Show-for-Apple-Podcast-Submission" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Prepare Your Show for Apple Podcast Submission"></a>Part 1. Prepare Your Show for Apple Podcast Submission</h2><p>Apple Podcasts submission is an excellent opportunity to earn severe exposure to your podcast. It would be best to start by sending your show to Apple for review. Then, we’ll help you with the steps to get your podcast accepted on Apple Podcasts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Apple Podcasts is not a podcast-hosting site. You’re not uploading your audio files to Apple. Instead, you’re telling Apple where to find your audio files on the web. Apple finds your files via an RSS feed that links to your hosting site.</p><h3 id="Publish-an-episode-on-a-hosting-site"><a href="#Publish-an-episode-on-a-hosting-site" class="headerlink" title="Publish an episode on a hosting site"></a>Publish an episode on a hosting site</h3><p>The first requirement of Apple Podcasts is a published episode. You need to give Apple a list to start. It can be a trailer or your first podcast episode posted on a hosting site. You can use any hosting service to publish your episode. One of the best is <a class="link"   href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/" >buzzsprout <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which offers hosting services, promotion, and marketing opportunities for podcasters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/apple-podcast-submit-1.jpg"                      alt="buzzsprout website"                ></p><p>A podcast hosting site stores your podcast files and distributes them to various podcast streaming platforms using an RSS feed. Your hosting site will automatically submit your podcast to podcast streaming platforms. But with the Apple podcast, you will have to submit manually only once.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Submit-Podcasts-to-Apple-Podcasts"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Submit-Podcasts-to-Apple-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

So we set out to find the easiest way to submit a podcast to Apple Podcasts and make it easy for everyone else.</p><p>After publishing your first episode to a podcast hosting site, there are a few required fields that you can find on settings:</p><ul><li>Podcast description</li><li>Podcast artwork (square)</li><li>Apple Podcasts category</li><li>Language selection</li><li>Explicit checkbox</li></ul><p>It’s time to submit your show to Apple Podcasts.</p><p>Step1 Go to Apple Podcasts directory instructions in Buzzsprout and click ‘Get listed.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/apple-podcast-submit-2.jpg"                      alt="click get listed"                ></p><p>Step2 You can see that we have already done steps 1 and 2, according to Apple. Now scroll down, and you’ll find your RSS feed URL. Copy your unique URL and click the ‘Launch Apple Podcasts Connect Website’ button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/apple-podcast-submit-3.jpg"                      alt="copy your rss feed url"                ></p><p>Step3 You’ll be redirected to Apple Podcasts login website.

Click on the option that says, ‘Add a show with an RSS feed,’ and click next. Then it asks for an ‘RSS Feed URL.’ Paste the RSS feed URL you copied from buzzsprout and click ‘Add.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/apple-podcast-submit-6.jpg"                      alt="choose a show type"                ></p><p>Step6 Once the RSS feed is added, the Apple Podcasts app will fetch all of the information related to that link. It will take a few minutes, but once it’s fetched, you can validate it and save it. Finally, click ‘Submit For Review’ to get verified. After 72 hours, you can see your podcasts listed in Apple Podcasts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/apple-podcast-submit-7.jpg"                      alt="click submit for review"                ></p><h3 id="Technical-requirements-for-RSS-feed"><a href="#Technical-requirements-for-RSS-feed" class="headerlink" title="Technical requirements for RSS feed"></a>Technical requirements for RSS feed</h3><p>Apple requires podcasts to comply with specific technical requirements and to provide quality content to provide an excellent experience for their listeners. Here are some requirements for an RSS feed from Apple:</p><ul><li>Show artwork and allow streaming playback of your episodes.</li><li>RSS feed URLs must be publicly addressable.</li><li>Only ASCII filenames and URLs.</li><li>All episodes must contain a GUID, which never changes.</li><li>Each episode must have a unique <enclosure> tag and its three required components — URL, length, and type.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Why-Get-Feed-Validation-Errors"><a href="#Part-3-Why-Get-Feed-Validation-Errors" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Why Get Feed Validation Errors?"></a>Part 3. Why Get Feed Validation Errors?</h2><p>Validation errors occur when the RSS feed isn’t formatted correctly or contains something it shouldn’t.</p><h3 id="Invalid-characters"><a href="#Invalid-characters" class="headerlink" title="Invalid characters"></a>Invalid characters</h3><p>An invalid feed is often caused by one or more “invalid” characters that need to be removed or edited—for example, using a series of dashes “-“ in the description to create a line break or an episode file that contains characters other than 0-1, a-z, or A-Z.</p><h3 id="Formatted-incorrect"><a href="#Formatted-incorrect" class="headerlink" title="Formatted incorrect"></a>Formatted incorrect</h3><p>An episode file uploaded using a file type that isn’t supported by Apple Podcasts and other podcast listening platforms. We recommend uploading audio files as MP3 files and video episodes as MP4 files.</p><p>Well, there are two ways to reach the root cause:</p><ul><li>Troubleshoot a failed validation by external tools. There are many to choose from, like Cast Feed Validator and Podbase Podcast Validator.</li><li>Get help from hosting providers. We suggest checking your hosting provider’s support forums or contacting the original hosting platform for assistance. They usually provide service with setting up RSS feeds.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-Best-Practices-for-Submitting-a-Podcast-to-Apple-Podcasts"><a href="#Part-4-Best-Practices-for-Submitting-a-Podcast-to-Apple-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Best Practices for Submitting a Podcast to Apple Podcasts"></a>Part 4. Best Practices for Submitting a Podcast to Apple Podcasts</h2><p>Your podcast submission may seem like a hassle at first, but once you have all of your materials organized and submitted, it will be much easier. By following these best practices for submitting a podcast to Apple Podcasts, you’ll be well on your way to achieving podcasting success.</p><h3 id="Fill-out-RSS-feed-data"><a href="#Fill-out-RSS-feed-data" class="headerlink" title="Fill out RSS feed data"></a>Fill out RSS feed data</h3><p>One big mistake people make when filling out RSS feed data is failing to do so. The problem is that many RSS readers can only read the feeds you have specified. Therefore, if you do not fill out all the required fields, it will not show up to your reader.</p><p>That is the most important practice you need to do. Make sure you put the data that Apple Podcasts requires in there.</p><h3 id="Compelling-description"><a href="#Compelling-description" class="headerlink" title="Compelling description"></a>Compelling description</h3><p>The description of your podcast is one of the first things people see, and it’s also one of the last things people see before downloading. For a listener to give the episode a second look, they first need to know that it’s something they should listen to. Therefore, it would be best to make a compelling description to convince someone to listen to your show.</p><p>Some basic rules of thumb for writing a good description:</p><ul><li>Include a clear subject line.</li><li>Introduce your topic.</li><li>Explain how the episode relates to the rest of your show.</li></ul><h3 id="Bold-cover-art"><a href="#Bold-cover-art" class="headerlink" title="Bold cover art"></a>Bold cover art</h3><p>A simple way to add personality to your podcast is by using bold cover art. It shows that you care about the quality of your audio content, and the image communicates your message. The cover art should be proactive and distinctive but subtle enough not to distract from the show itself.</p><p>Remember that most people use mobile devices to browse podcasts. That means your cover art must be easily readable on small screens. So having minimal text with large fonts is the best option.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Apple has been criticized by podcasters who claim that Apple’s podcast submission process is complex, confusing, and challenging to navigate. So that’s where we come in.</p><p>This article discusses what it takes to get featured on the Apple Podcasts podcast directory. We discuss what it means to get featured on Apple Podcasts, why you should be submitting your show, and why it’s worth it.</p><h3 id="Publish-an-episode-on-a-hosting-site-1"><a href="#Publish-an-episode-on-a-hosting-site-1" class="headerlink" title="Publish an episode on a hosting site"></a>Publish an episode on a hosting site</h3><p>The first requirement of Apple Podcasts is a published episode.

Here are some requirements for an RSS feed from Apple:</p><ul><li>Show artwork and allow streaming playback of your episodes.</li><li>RSS feed URLs must be publicly addressable.</li><li>Only ASCII filenames and URLs.</li><li>All episodes must contain a GUID, which never changes.</li><li>Each episode must have a unique <enclosure> tag and its three required components — URL, length, and type.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Why-Get-Feed-Validation-Errors-1"><a href="#Part-3-Why-Get-Feed-Validation-Errors-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Why Get Feed Validation Errors?"></a>Part 3. Why Get Feed Validation Errors?</h2><p>Validation errors occur when the RSS feed isn’t formatted correctly or contains something it shouldn’t.</p><h3 id="Invalid-characters-1"><a href="#Invalid-characters-1" class="headerlink" title="Invalid characters"></a>Invalid characters</h3><p>An invalid feed is often caused by one or more “invalid” characters that need to be removed or edited—for example, using a series of dashes “-“ in the description to create a line break or an episode file that contains characters other than 0-1, a-z, or A-Z.</p><h3 id="Formatted-incorrect-1"><a href="#Formatted-incorrect-1" class="headerlink" title="Formatted incorrect"></a>Formatted incorrect</h3><p>An episode file uploaded using a file type that isn’t supported by Apple Podcasts and other podcast listening platforms. We recommend uploading audio files as MP3 files and video episodes as MP4 files.</p><p>Well, there are two ways to reach the root cause:</p><ul><li>Troubleshoot a failed validation by external tools. There are many to choose from, like Cast Feed Validator and Podbase Podcast Validator.</li><li>Get help from hosting providers. We suggest checking your hosting provider’s support forums or contacting the original hosting platform for assistance. They usually provide service with setting up RSS feeds.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-Best-Practices-for-Submitting-a-Podcast-to-Apple-Podcasts-1"><a href="#Part-4-Best-Practices-for-Submitting-a-Podcast-to-Apple-Podcasts-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Best Practices for Submitting a Podcast to Apple Podcasts</h2><p>Your podcast submission may seem like a hassle at first, but once you have all of your materials organized and submitted, it will be much easier. By following these best practices for submitting a podcast to Apple Podcasts, you’ll be well on your way to achieving podcasting success.</p><h3 id="Fill-out-RSS-feed-data-1"><a href="#Fill-out-RSS-feed-data-1" class="headerlink" title="Fill out RSS feed data"></a>Fill out RSS feed data</h3><p>One big mistake people make when filling out RSS feed data is failing to do so. The problem is that many RSS readers can only read the feeds you have specified. Therefore, if you do not fill out all the required fields, it will not show up to your reader.</p><p>That is the most important practice you need to do. Make sure you put the data that Apple Podcasts requires in there.</p><h3 id="Compelling-description-1"><a href="#Compelling-description-1" class="headerlink" title="Compelling description"></a>Compelling description</h3><p>The description of your podcast is one of the first things people see, and it’s also one of the last things people see before downloading. For a listener to give the episode a second look, they first need to know that it’s something they should listen to. Therefore, it would be best to make a compelling description to convince someone to listen to your show.</p><p>Some basic rules of thumb for writing a good description:</p><ul><li>Include a clear subject line.</li><li>Introduce your topic.</li><li>Explain how the episode relates to the rest of your show.</li></ul><h3 id="Bold-cover-art-1"><a href="#Bold-cover-art-1" class="headerlink" title="Bold cover art"></a>Bold cover art</h3><p>A simple way to add personality to your podcast is by using bold cover art. It shows that you care about the quality of your audio content, and the image communicates your message. The cover art should be proactive and distinctive but subtle enough not to distract from the show itself.</p><p>Remember that most people use mobile devices to browse podcasts. That means your cover art must be easily readable on small screens. So having minimal text with large fonts is the best option.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Apple has been criticized by podcasters who claim that Apple’s podcast submission process is complex, confusing, and challenging to navigate.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Unleashing-Clarity-The-Ultimate-Video-Enhancer-2-2-Techniques"><a href="#Unleashing-Clarity-The-Ultimate-Video-Enhancer-2-2-Techniques" class="headerlink" title="Unleashing Clarity: The Ultimate Video Enhancer 2.2 Techniques"></a>Unleashing Clarity: The Ultimate Video Enhancer 2.2 Techniques</h2><p>We’ve all experienced moments when the quality of a video isn’t as good as we’d like it to be. This is especially true; an unsteady hand, poor lighting, or low-quality technology can prevent all damage to a video.</p><p>You’re in luck if you’ve ever wondered how to improve video quality. We’re going to look over the finest video quality enhancers today. Many video enhancers have been launched so far, and you might find it difficult to choose one for you. Let’s begin:</p><h2 id="Video-enhancer-2-2"><a href="#Video-enhancer-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Video enhancer 2.2"></a>Video enhancer 2.2</h2><p>Video Enhancer is an application that uses the Super Resolution approach to boost video resolution. Super Resolution is a clever video upsizing method that uses information from neighboring frames to upsize the current frame. It gathers data. Therefore the more sequential frames processed, the greater the quality.</p><p>If the image in your video doesn’t change too quickly, information from multiple frames can be combined to create a larger image, showing details that would otherwise be concealed. However, no regular image resize&#x2F;resample techniques can achieve this quality because there isn’t enough information in one frame.</p><h3 id="How-to-use-Video-Enhancer-2-2"><a href="#How-to-use-Video-Enhancer-2-2" class="headerlink" title="How to use Video Enhancer 2.2?"></a>How to use Video Enhancer 2.2?</h3><p>Video Enhancers allow you to:</p><ul><li>Increase the resolution of your video with the Video Super-Resolution approach, which gives incredible quality by leveraging information from prior frames. At the same time, other resize methods only use information from one current frame. In addition, you may now convert SD video to HD!</li><li>Use VirtualDub’s hundreds of video filters to perform anything you want with your video, including deinterlacing, denoising, deshaking, color correction, sharpening, and visual effects.</li></ul><p>Because all filters and codecs function in independent threads, Video Enhancer is much faster than VirtualDub.</p><ul><li>Open any video that can be played on your system and re-compress it using any video codec (DirectShow, DMO, or Video for Windows) that you have installed.</li></ul><p>However, the step-by-step on how to use Video Enhancer 2.2</p><p><strong>Step 1: Import the file</strong></p><p>Download Video Enhancer 2.2 and launch the software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-1.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p>Once you have launched the software, import the file by clicking on ‘Browse’ to enhance video resolution.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Edit the file</strong></p><p>After uploading the video file, click on ‘Add a filter,’ and a pop-up window shows various editing options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-2.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p>You can create chains with any number of VirtualDub and Super Resolution filters to apply to your video in the Advanced user interface mode. You can filter your video before, after, in between, or even instead of scaling.</p><p>With over a hundred VirtualDub filters, you can edit your video, including deinterlace, denoise, deshake, color correction, visual effects, etc. Video Enhancer will most likely recognize your filters if you have VirtualDub installed.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Improve Video Resolution:</strong></p><p>Once you are done editing the video, close the pop-up window and click on ‘Add Super Resolution Resize’ and change the video resolution.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-3.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Save the edited video file</strong></p><p>Click the Save video to store or share your finished video if you’re satisfied with the outcome. You can also change the configuration of the output file by selecting your preferred video and audio compressing options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-4.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p>Video Enhancer will scan your system for 32-bit video and audio compressors and provide them in drop-down lists for you to choose from. If you have codecs from Video Enhancer’s favored list, it will advise which codec to use and at what bitrate. The recommended bitrate is determined by the final video resolution and the codec. After that, it displays its recommendations in the text; you must select the codecs and set the bitrate in its settings to finish the process.</p><h2 id="Alternative-ways-to-enhance-video"><a href="#Alternative-ways-to-enhance-video" class="headerlink" title="Alternative ways to enhance video"></a>Alternative ways to enhance video</h2><h3 id="1-Filmora"><a href="#1-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1. Filmora"></a>1. Filmora</h3><p>Compatibility: Windows&#x2F;Mac</p><p>Wondershare Filmora is, without a doubt, the best video editor on the market, and it deserves to be at the top of our list.</p><p>In the Filmora video editor, you’ll find some professional tools to help you increase video quality and over 300 creative filters and effects to give your movie a new, fresh look without putting in a lot of effort. Apart from the features that allow you to adjust video rotation effortlessly, this program is one of the most dependable.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Import media files</strong></p><p>To access the primary editing interface, open Wondershare Filmora and select “New Project.” Then select “Import” to load files from your computer. You can also connect your devices by dragging and dropping files into the software or using the Import option. Filmora can handle images, video, and audio files with ease.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-5.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Enhance video quality</strong></p><p>Drag &amp; drop all the media files onto the timeline tracks after being imported into the application. Right-click on the media clip you want to improve and select “Edit.” Rotate, crop, speed, and adjust are just a few fundamental options. You may quickly adjust the contrast, saturation, brightness, and hue from this menu. It is less difficult to edit audio. Select the Audio column and adjust the settings as desired. You may change the output volume, fade in, fade out, and pitch.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-6.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Export and Share video</strong></p><p>Click the Play button to see a preview of the new video; once you’ve improved the video quality, select Export to store or share your finished video if you’re satisfied with the outcome. The Format tab allows you to encode the video into several video formats, or the Device tab allows you to export the video to common mobile pictures and portable devices. Finally, go to the DVD tab if you wish to burn a DVD. Additionally, you can post it online using the YouTube option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-7.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><h3 id="2-iMovie"><a href="#2-iMovie" class="headerlink" title="2. iMovie"></a>2. iMovie</h3><p>Compatibility: macOS, iOS</p><p>Instead of paying hundreds of dollars on video editing tools, Mac users can use iMovie to edit their videos. The best thing is that the software works on iPhones, iPads, and Apple laptops, allowing you to edit your footage as soon as you take it.</p><p>iMovie supports 4K films and makes the editing process enjoyable and simple. You only need to arrange your clips on the timeline, choose background music, make opening titles and closing credits, or add interesting visual effects. Then, your videos are ready to be shared with the public.</p><p>You can use the following steps to enhance the video quality:</p><p>Step 1: Navigate to the project browser and choose the video clip you wish to modify. To begin the resizing process, click the crop button. You can also press the R key on your keyboard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-8.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p>Step 2: Drag and resize your movie by dragging and repositioning the green rectangle. Stop pressing the resize button after you’re happy with the final size.</p><p>Step 3: View the video on the viewer to see how it looks after resizing.</p><h3 id="3-HDConvert"><a href="#3-HDConvert" class="headerlink" title="3.

Additionally, the platform provides a variety of export options, including the ability to change the resolution of your video files. There are no file size restrictions, so that you can upload any file to HDconvert, regardless of its size. However, huge video files may take some time to upload.</p><p>After the upload is complete, you can select various video resolutions, ranging from 240p to UHD 4K. If you wish to export your video files in Full HD, Ultra HD, or 4K resolution, you’ll need to upgrade to the premium edition of HDconvert. Furthermore, use the free version of HDconvert to modify the resolution of your videos. Unfortunately, you won’t be able to change the default  video codec to  video codec.</p><p>You can use the following steps to enhance the video quality:</p><p>Step 1: Go to HDconvert.com and press the button in the center to begin converting a file right away.</p><p>Step 2: To continue, upload a video file and select MP4 as the desired video format.</p><p>Step 3: Select Full HD 1080p as the output video quality if you’re on the premium plan. Aside from that, you can only convert video to HD 720P.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-10.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p>Step 4: Once the standard video has been converted to HD, download the video to your device as soon as possible because the download URL will expire in 24 hours.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-11.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><h3 id="4-InShot"><a href="#4-InShot" class="headerlink" title="4.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Innovative-Designs-Unleashed-Comprehensive-Guide-to-Animation-Suites"><a href="#Innovative-Designs-Unleashed-Comprehensive-Guide-to-Animation-Suites" class="headerlink" title="Innovative Designs Unleashed: Comprehensive Guide to Animation Suites"></a>Innovative Designs Unleashed: Comprehensive Guide to Animation Suites</h2><p>Using software like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for editing your videos ready for uploading or release is fast and effective but first you have to get your files ready to import. We will be talking about 3d model creation today which is the first step in 3D animation creation. There are many options out there with their own advantages and drawbacks as well as price points and additional support via tutorials and in some cases assets to help speed up the creation process.</p><p>In every case you can always just buy ready-made models for your animations but in doing that you lose the option and the flexibility to have a completely custom asset with the ability to alter when needed.</p><p>There are many steps to creating that perfect video and in time you will have your preferred method. We call this our workflow. Achieving a comfortable workflow is one of the most important and influential processes you will undergo as a creative artist, this is due to the fact even with the best ideas and all the drive in the world, if you struggle to translate that into a 3d model then it stays in your head and no one will see it.</p><p>With this in mind let’s look at some of the options available to us and how we can use them for this first most important step in our creative process. Remember to pick one that does not limit your creativity and gives you the tools you need to translate thought into visualization.</p><h2 id="ZBrush-by-MAXON"><a href="#ZBrush-by-MAXON" class="headerlink" title="ZBrush by MAXON"></a>ZBrush by MAXON</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/zbrush-by-maxon.jpg"                      alt="zbrush by maxon"                ></p><p>Zbrush is what is considered an industry standard 3D modeling software and is one of the most used by many leading studios. This is a paid software with different versions meeting different needs depending on what you feel you need. You can create impressive 3d models with very high levels of detail without overusing your computer resources resulting in a stable and fluid working process. Zbrush is very powerful with many features, too many features to highlight in this guide but as an overview some features that can improve your process are:</p><ul><li>You can import or create alphas easily for micro detailing.</li><li>There is a live boolean to create unique items within your sculpts.</li><li>It’s very easy to use the Zremesher to create a new clean topology of your sculptures.<br> Dynamesh lets you work and retopo as you go so the sculpt retains detail.</li><li>Work with multiple levels of divisions at the same time with the Sub Divide tools.</li></ul><p>This is just a tiny scratch on the surface of what ZBrush can do. There are all the tools you need within this software to create an amazing jaw dropping model for your videos but this is a paid software which is important to remember when making the decision to go with this one as you will need animation and rigging software as well as in some cases a UV editor. Another thing to remember is system requirements depending on your setup. Minimum system requirements are as follows:</p><p><strong>For Windows:</strong></p><ul><li>64-bit Windows 10 or 11 .</li><li>Core 2 Duo or AMD equivalent with SSE2 technology or better.</li><li>4GB of ram with a strong recommendation for 6GB or more.</li><li>8GB of free hard drive space.</li><li>A graphics card with OpenGL 3.3 or higher and Vulkan 1.1 or higher.</li><li>Monitor with 32-bit color and a resolution of 1280x1024.</li><li>Mouse or Wacom compatible (WinTab API) pen tablet.</li></ul><p><strong>For Mac:</strong></p><ul><li>Mac OSX: 10.14 or above</li><li>Everything else is the same as above.</li></ul><p>Zbrush runs the same on Windows and Mac so there is no advantage over the other and the only real elements that you need to consider is your CPU and your RAM, A faster CPU with more cores will make this program run more stable and 16GB or RAM or more will also help with stability so if your running an older computer this will still work but you may be limited to pixel count but that is true for all 3D creation software.</p><h2 id="Autodesk-Maya"><a href="#Autodesk-Maya" class="headerlink" title="Autodesk Maya"></a>Autodesk Maya</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/autodesk-maya.jpg"                      alt="autodesk maya"                ></p><p>This guide wouldn’t be complete without introducing Maya, Maya is another industry standard for modeling but also offers animation and rigging tools meaning this covers a lot more ground that some of the other 3D modeling software.</p><p>Maya is very powerful but for this guide I will only be talking about the 3D modeling creation tools as I feel other topics need their own space but that said I think it is important to mention this is a complete workflow from creation to the exportation of your movie file into Filmora ready for editing and uploading to your audience.</p><p>Again this software has a list of features that is simply too large to cover so i will highlight some useful features for your creative process.</p><ul><li>Polygon modeling lets you create 3D models based on vertexes, edges and faces.</li><li>Nurbs modeling lets you create 3d models from geometric primitives and drawn curves</li><li>Sculpting tools allows you to create organic sculpts</li><li>Subdivision workflow for better performance in higher pixel counts</li><li>Built in UV editing</li><li>Orthopedic viewport so you can check dimensions from whichever side you need</li></ul><p>Again we are only scratching the surface of what Maya can do. Maya is capable of creating hyper realistic hard surface and organic models for use within animation and also provides all the tools needed to get a perfect rendering. Again system performance is important to consider when choosing software and the minimum requirements are as follows:</p><ul><li>Windows 10 or 11, macOS x or above and linux but see website for compatibility.</li><li>64-bit Intel or AMD multi-core processor with SSE4.2, M series Mac under rosetta 2.</li><li>8GB of RAM but 16GB or more is recommended.</li><li>7GB free disk space for the install.</li><li>Three-button mouse.</li><li>Graphics card please see website for compatibility</li></ul><p>This is a paid software and can be expensive so please consider this when choosing your desired workflow but also consider that this is a complete workflow right up to importing your video file into Filmora so the price may be justified compared to multiple software. Another thing to consider is you can mostly get the desired results you want without the use of a drawing tablet cutting even more cost.</p><h2 id="3DCoat-2022"><a href="#3DCoat-2022" class="headerlink" title="3DCoat 2022"></a>3DCoat 2022</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/3-coat-2022.jpg"                      alt="3 coat 2022"                ></p><p>3DCoat was first released in 2007 and has released constant updates inline with the 3D art community needs. Being a smaller team of developers it’s quite impressive what they have achieved as this is a fully featured 3D art software capable of creating very nice detailed models. When used with the likes of Daz 3D, Keyshot or similar animation software you can easily create the animation you are planning. This is not a full workflow but it is very close to one and the team are constantly releasing updates so one day it might be. You have the ability to UV your models as well as texture, paint and sculpt all within one program and this has one of the most impressive live retopo tools around called voxel modeling mode. Key features are as follows:</p><ul><li>Easy texturing and PBR with the use of smart materials and a HDRL viewport.</li><li>Voxel sculpting with complex boolean operations and adaptive dynamic tessellation.</li><li>Classic polygonal modeling is fully supported and also supports splines and joints.</li><li>Auto-retopology with user-defined edge loops but also fast and easy manual tools.</li><li>Professional tools for creating and editing UV-sets.</li><li>Native global uniform unwrapping algorithms.</li><li>PBR and HDRL rendering for concept exporting.</li><li>Use of scripts for repetitive actions.</li><li>And many more.</li></ul><p>This is paid software but with many options to buy as well as unlimited learning period which you will have to take into consideration when you are deciding to take this in your workflow. And again another consideration is your hardware and 3DCoat is complex due to the complexity of their software , as a point of reference there website states they consider a Surface Pro as the minimal hardware needed to use there software, minimum system specs are as follows:</p><ul><li>64-Bit Windows 7&#x2F;8&#x2F;10&#x2F;11, macOS 10.13 High Sierra or higher, Linux Ubuntu 20.04+</li><li>CPU m3 1.00 GHz,</li><li>4GB RAM</li><li>Intel HD Graphics 615</li><li>This will allow painting textures up to 2K and sculpting up to 1 million triangles</li></ul><p>What makes 3DCoat a good choice is the fact they have unlimited learning allowing you to journey into sculpting without putting any money in to start and in confection with other software it is very powerful.</p><h2 id="Blender"><a href="#Blender" class="headerlink" title="Blender"></a>Blender</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/blender-modeling-software.jpg"                      alt="blender modeling software"                ></p><p>So now it’s time to talk about Blender, the Blender institute set off with one main goal in mind and that was to put powerful tools for use with 3D and CG in the hands of artists in the form of free&#x2F;open-source software. This is commendable and they have in large achieved what they set out to do, not only can you sculpt or model in Blender you can also rig and animate and add VFX to your projects.</p><p>It’s impressive to see what you can do with free software and you will be able to achieve very good results. What you miss out on in the form of automation tools and boutique brushes and toolsets this makes up for in an ever-expanding community driven tutorials and guides. With this being free it doesn’t make sense to not have this installed even if you have a different workflow due to the ability to expand with new skills that may work their way into your daily task. Key features are as follows:</p><ul><li>Render with impressive results thanks to cycles,</li><li>An extensive toolset for modeling, curves and retopology</li><li>Sculpting tools provide the power and flexibility needed in several stages of production</li><li>Designed for animation in mind</li><li>Push the boundaries of story art by drawing in a 3d environment</li><li>Powerful post FX and VFX tools like object motion tracking</li><li>Fully customisable UI and controles</li><li>Python API means every tool can be customized and scripted</li></ul><p>Blender is complex software and due to this some functions require different hardware specs but as a rule the higher the CPU speed and cores plus the more RAM you have the more you can do at any given time. With this said the minimum system requirements are as follows@</p><ul><li>Windows 8.1,10 and 11, macOS 10.13 and above and Linux supported</li><li>64-Bit quad core CPU with SSE2 support</li><li>8GB RAM</li><li>Full HD display</li><li>Mouse, trackpad or pen+tablet</li><li>Graphics card with 2GB VRAM, OpenGL 4.3 support</li></ul><p>Blender receives regular updates and is supported by community scripts and content and is becoming a new go to tool for 3D artists in all industries and backgrounds making it a real contender when picking a workflow.</p><p><strong>From Desktop to Portable</strong></p><p>There are lots of options and this list is in no way stating what you may already use is not good enough, this is just what is being used in the industry and is more accessible to a starter or someone who works from home and doesn’t want to spend thousands upfront for their software.</p><p>That being said there is more than just the desktop workflow and some people lead busy lifestyles and are always on the move. This is where I would like to introduce the portable workflow. Due to the fact the Ipad Pro is considered a must have for portable creativity and with recent releases there has never been a better time to start i will be showing Ipad compatible apps.</p><h2 id="Forger-by-Maxon"><a href="#Forger-by-Maxon" class="headerlink" title="Forger by Maxon"></a>Forger by Maxon</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/forger-by-maxon.jpg"                      alt="forger by maxon"                ></p><p>Forger is released as a standalone app or part of the Maxon one. Forger gives you all the tools needed to create sculptures and models on the go which you can be proud of. Designed by artists for artists the features are quite large considering this is running on an ipad and with the seamlessness of importing and exporting to and from software such as cinema 4D this can be worked into your workflow very easily. One feature of Forger that people like to talk about is the ability to use your ipad camera and view your model in the real world using augmented reality.</p><p>Some of the key features of Forger but not limited to are as follows:</p><ul><li>Multi-resolution mesh sculpting via catmull0clark mesh subdivisions.</li><li>Volume-based quad-dominant remeshing.</li><li>Sculpt in layers.</li><li>Sculpt with a mask with the ability to clear, invert, blur, grow and shrink your masks.</li><li>Ability to close holes in existing meshes</li><li>Simple auto-generation of mesh UVs.</li><li>Symmetrical sculpting based on axis of choice</li><li>Ability to reapply symmetry to topologically symmetrical meshes.</li></ul><p>Forger is very powerful and don’t let the fact it’s on an ipad make you think it’s inferior to the bigger desktop software as this is very capable of getting the results you are looking for. It just takes a bit of researching and a different learning curve. Due to the fact it is on an ipad the system requirements are easier to achieve, minimum system requirements are as follows</p><ul><li>IOS 15 or later</li><li>Ipad pro or current model ipad</li></ul><p>A note from the developers, the more complex the model being sculpted, the more RAM required. While there is no screen size requirement, as anticipated the bigger the better when it comes to sculpting workspace.</p><h2 id="Nomad-Sculpt"><a href="#Nomad-Sculpt" class="headerlink" title="Nomad Sculpt"></a>Nomad Sculpt</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/nomad-sculpt-software.jpg"                      alt="nomad sculpt software"                ></p><p>Nomad Sculpt is another contender offering powerful tools that artists can use to sculpt outstanding models for your animations. With a fixed price payment once you buy this you get regular updates and added features meaning you can buy with the confidence you will always have the best tools available. Nomad has a growing community of tutors giving guides and tutorials to get your desired results so no matter your experience Nomad is accessible to you.

It works by taking multiple pictures at different exposures and then combining them into one photo. This results in a photo with more detail and less noise.</p><p>Because of computational photography, the iPhone automatically adjusts color, sunlight, contrast, skin, saturation, and background blur.</p><p>The iPhone has had this feature for a few years now and it keeps getting better with every new release.</p><h2 id="Camera-Comparison-Different-Versions-of-Smart-HDR-Vs-Previous-HDR-in-iPhone"><a href="#Camera-Comparison-Different-Versions-of-Smart-HDR-Vs-Previous-HDR-in-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Camera Comparison: Different Versions of Smart HDR Vs Previous HDR in iPhone"></a>Camera Comparison: Different Versions of Smart HDR Vs Previous HDR in iPhone</h2><p>When you compare the latest Smart HDR technology used in iPhone to the prior HDR, Smart HDR wins in every aspect.

With Smart HDR features, your camera will take buffer frames,</p><ul><li>where you’ll need to tap the shutter before and after, that capture images in different exposures so that your iPhone will capture everything, even highlights, shadows, and background objects.</li><li>Newer models of iPhone, equipped with Apple’s A12 Bionic chip, have Smart HDR, which automatically adjusts the dynamic range by employing AI technology.</li><li>If you’re looking to use HDR for any type of photo, use your photos with a significant amount of high contrast with dramatic, meaningful light or shadow contrast and be sure to keep your camera as steady as possible to get the best results.</li><li>Smart HDR can vastly improve your photos without you doing anything different.</li><li>It seems to use both an image sensor and a depth map from its TrueDepth camera setup.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/what-are-auto-hdr-smart-hdr-3-and-4-shooting-modes-4.jpg"                      alt="smart hdr"                ></p><h3 id="Auto-HDR-iPhone-X"><a href="#Auto-HDR-iPhone-X" class="headerlink" title="Auto HDR (iPhone X)"></a>Auto HDR (iPhone X)</h3><p>Auto HDR is a feature in the camera of the iPhone X series that takes multiple pictures at different exposures and then combines them to create one well-exposed photo. One of the things that make the iPhone camera so great is computational photography.</p><p>This feature is designed to improve the quality of your photos by automatically applying a high dynamic range (HDR) effect.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Transforming-Videos-with-Unprecedented-Clarity-Using-VCE-2-2"><a href="#Transforming-Videos-with-Unprecedented-Clarity-Using-VCE-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Transforming Videos with Unprecedented Clarity Using VCE 2.2"></a>Transforming Videos with Unprecedented Clarity Using VCE 2.2</h2><p>We’ve all experienced moments when the quality of a video isn’t as good as we’d like it to be. This is especially true; an unsteady hand, poor lighting, or low-quality technology can prevent all damage to a video.</p><p>You’re in luck if you’ve ever wondered how to improve video quality. We’re going to look over the finest video quality enhancers today. Many video enhancers have been launched so far, and you might find it difficult to choose one for you. Let’s begin:</p><h2 id="Video-enhancer-2-2"><a href="#Video-enhancer-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Video enhancer 2.2"></a>Video enhancer 2.2</h2><p>Video Enhancer is an application that uses the Super Resolution approach to boost video resolution. Super Resolution is a clever video upsizing method that uses information from neighboring frames to upsize the current frame. It gathers data. Therefore the more sequential frames processed, the greater the quality.</p><p>If the image in your video doesn’t change too quickly, information from multiple frames can be combined to create a larger image, showing details that would otherwise be concealed. However, no regular image resize&#x2F;resample techniques can achieve this quality because there isn’t enough information in one frame.</p><h3 id="How-to-use-Video-Enhancer-2-2"><a href="#How-to-use-Video-Enhancer-2-2" class="headerlink" title="How to use Video Enhancer 2.2?"></a>How to use Video Enhancer 2.2?</h3><p>Video Enhancers allow you to:</p><ul><li>Increase the resolution of your video with the Video Super-Resolution approach, which gives incredible quality by leveraging information from prior frames. At the same time, other resize methods only use information from one current frame. In addition, you may now convert SD video to HD!</li><li>Use VirtualDub’s hundreds of video filters to perform anything you want with your video, including deinterlacing, denoising, deshaking, color correction, sharpening, and visual effects.</li></ul><p>Because all filters and codecs function in independent threads, Video Enhancer is much faster than VirtualDub.</p><ul><li>Open any video that can be played on your system and re-compress it using any video codec (DirectShow, DMO, or Video for Windows) that you have installed.</li></ul><p>However, the step-by-step on how to use Video Enhancer 2.2</p><p><strong>Step 1: Import the file</strong></p><p>Download Video Enhancer 2.2 and launch the software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-1.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p>Once you have launched the software, import the file by clicking on ‘Browse’ to enhance video resolution.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Edit the file</strong></p><p>After uploading the video file, click on ‘Add a filter,’ and a pop-up window shows various editing options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-2.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p>You can create chains with any number of VirtualDub and Super Resolution filters to apply to your video in the Advanced user interface mode. You can filter your video before, after, in between, or even instead of scaling.</p><p>With over a hundred VirtualDub filters, you can edit your video, including deinterlace, denoise, deshake, color correction, visual effects, etc. Video Enhancer will most likely recognize your filters if you have VirtualDub installed.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Improve Video Resolution:</strong></p><p>Once you are done editing the video, close the pop-up window and click on ‘Add Super Resolution Resize’ and change the video resolution.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-3.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Save the edited video file</strong></p><p>Click the Save video to store or share your finished video if you’re satisfied with the outcome. You can also change the configuration of the output file by selecting your preferred video and audio compressing options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-4.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p>Video Enhancer will scan your system for 32-bit video and audio compressors and provide them in drop-down lists for you to choose from. If you have codecs from Video Enhancer’s favored list, it will advise which codec to use and at what bitrate. The recommended bitrate is determined by the final video resolution and the codec. After that, it displays its recommendations in the text; you must select the codecs and set the bitrate in its settings to finish the process.</p><h2 id="Alternative-ways-to-enhance-video"><a href="#Alternative-ways-to-enhance-video" class="headerlink" title="Alternative ways to enhance video"></a>Alternative ways to enhance video</h2><h3 id="1-Filmora"><a href="#1-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1. Filmora"></a>1. Filmora</h3><p>Compatibility: Windows&#x2F;Mac</p><p>Wondershare Filmora is, without a doubt, the best video editor on the market, and it deserves to be at the top of our list.</p><p>In the Filmora video editor, you’ll find some professional tools to help you increase video quality and over 300 creative filters and effects to give your movie a new, fresh look without putting in a lot of effort. Apart from the features that allow you to adjust video rotation effortlessly, this program is one of the most dependable.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Import media files</strong></p><p>To access the primary editing interface, open Wondershare Filmora and select “New Project.” Then select “Import” to load files from your computer. You can also connect your devices by dragging and dropping files into the software or using the Import option. Filmora can handle images, video, and audio files with ease.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-5.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Enhance video quality</strong></p><p>Drag &amp; drop all the media files onto the timeline tracks after being imported into the application. Right-click on the media clip you want to improve and select “Edit.” Rotate, crop, speed, and adjust are just a few fundamental options. You may quickly adjust the contrast, saturation, brightness, and hue from this menu. It is less difficult to edit audio. Select the Audio column and adjust the settings as desired. You may change the output volume, fade in, fade out, and pitch.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-6.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Export and Share video</strong></p><p>Click the Play button to see a preview of the new video; once you’ve improved the video quality, select Export to store or share your finished video if you’re satisfied with the outcome. The Format tab allows you to encode the video into several video formats, or the Device tab allows you to export the video to common mobile pictures and portable devices. Finally, go to the DVD tab if you wish to burn a DVD. Additionally, you can post it online using the YouTube option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-7.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><h3 id="2-iMovie"><a href="#2-iMovie" class="headerlink" title="2. iMovie"></a>2. iMovie</h3><p>Compatibility: macOS, iOS</p><p>Instead of paying hundreds of dollars on video editing tools, Mac users can use iMovie to edit their videos. The best thing is that the software works on iPhones, iPads, and Apple laptops, allowing you to edit your footage as soon as you take it.</p><p>iMovie supports 4K films and makes the editing process enjoyable and simple. You only need to arrange your clips on the timeline, choose background music, make opening titles and closing credits, or add interesting visual effects. Then, your videos are ready to be shared with the public.</p><p>You can use the following steps to enhance the video quality:</p><p>Step 1: Navigate to the project browser and choose the video clip you wish to modify. To begin the resizing process, click the crop button. You can also press the R key on your keyboard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-8.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p>Step 2: Drag and resize your movie by dragging and repositioning the green rectangle. Stop pressing the resize button after you’re happy with the final size.</p><p>Step 3: View the video on the viewer to see how it looks after resizing.</p><h3 id="3-HDConvert"><a href="#3-HDConvert" class="headerlink" title="3.

HDConvert</h3><p>Compatibility: Online</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-9.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p>HDconvert is a video file converter that enables users to change the format of their video files. Additionally, the platform provides a variety of export options, including the ability to change the resolution of your video files. There are no file size restrictions, so that you can upload any file to HDconvert, regardless of its size. However, huge video files may take some time to upload.</p><p>After the upload is complete, you can select various video resolutions, ranging from 240p to UHD 4K. If you wish to export your video files in Full HD, Ultra HD, or 4K resolution, you’ll need to upgrade to the premium edition of HDconvert. Furthermore, use the free version of HDconvert to modify the resolution of your videos. Unfortunately, you won’t be able to change the default  video codec to  video codec.</p><p>You can use the following steps to enhance the video quality:</p><p>Step 1: Go to HDconvert.com and press the button in the center to begin converting a file right away.</p><p>Step 2: To continue, upload a video file and select MP4 as the desired video format.</p><p>Step 3: Select Full HD 1080p as the output video quality if you’re on the premium plan. Aside from that, you can only convert video to HD 720P.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-10.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p>Step 4: Once the standard video has been converted to HD, download the video to your device as soon as possible because the download URL will expire in 24 hours.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-11.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><h3 id="4-InShot"><a href="#4-InShot" class="headerlink" title="4.

Regardless of your sharp photography skills or how perfect the shot is, images are almost always incomplete without editing. As an aspiring photographer, there are a few editing tips and hacks you should know to make the process easier and worthwhile.</p><p>To help you bring out the best in your photos, the following article contains some helpful photography editing tips. You can follow these techniques to create stunning images seamlessly.</p><h2 id="Part-1-10-Photography-Editing-Tips-for-Creating-Amazing-Photos"><a href="#Part-1-10-Photography-Editing-Tips-for-Creating-Amazing-Photos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: 10 Photography Editing Tips for Creating Amazing Photos"></a>Part 1: 10 Photography Editing Tips for Creating Amazing Photos</h2><p>Image editing is virtually an inevitable need these days. Numerous photography editing software are available to help enhance your images in multiple ways. These apps come laden with valuable features to help you create remarkable photos. But it is all in vain if you do not know how to utilize these tools properly.</p><p>To assist you in this regard, we have compiled a list of 10 effective photography editing tips and tricks. These are bound to prove fruitful in helping you bring your creative visions to life.</p><h3 id="1-Cropping-Can-Help"><a href="#1-Cropping-Can-Help" class="headerlink" title="1. Cropping Can Help"></a>1. Cropping Can Help</h3><p>One of the most important aspects of a photo is its framing and composition. While capturing an image, you might be paying close attention to every corner in the frame. Still, there might come times when things can get a little out of hand.</p><p>Luckily, every photography editing software offers the primary crop tool. You can easily omit unnecessary parts of your image with a few simple clicks. You can also seek help from a grid to ensure that your subject is in the center of the frame. Thus, you can add a symmetrical look to your images.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/photography-editing-tips-1.jpg"                      alt="crop the image"                ></p><h3 id="2-Presets-are-your-Friends"><a href="#2-Presets-are-your-Friends" class="headerlink" title="2. Presets are your Friends"></a>2. Presets are your Friends</h3><p>When processing multiple images at once, the editing process can be tiring and bothersome. To help you out, most photography editing software comes with a range of presets and tools you can apply to your photos. If all your images need similar changes, these presets can come in handy. You can also create the perfect combination of settings yourself and apply them instantly.</p><p> Image name: photography-editing-tips-2.jpg” alt&#x3D;”manga black white effect” class&#x3D;”img-fluid” &#x2F;&gt;</p><p>Image alt: use presets for image editing</p><h3 id="3-Play-With-the-Colors"><a href="#3-Play-With-the-Colors" class="headerlink" title="3. Play With the Colors"></a>3. Play With the Colors</h3><p>If you look around closely, you can find that everything is associated with a specific color. From the lush green grass to the vibrant dreamy blue skies, everything has its shade. But upon closer inspection, you will find that it’s not just a single constituent color. The grass’s green contains shades of yellow, brown, and orange too.</p><p>If you train your eye to see these hidden colors, you can easily make your images pop. Under the right lighting, you can see the various shades underlying seemingly monochromatic things. You can play with these colors using simple color grading techniques to bring a more vibrant look to your image. Adjust the vibrancy, saturation, and tint until you get the look you want in your image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/photography-editing-tips-3.jpg"                      alt="play with the image colors"                ></p><h3 id="4-Adjust-the-Contrast"><a href="#4-Adjust-the-Contrast" class="headerlink" title="4. Adjust the Contrast"></a>4. Adjust the Contrast</h3><p>One of the main reasons your images are looking flat is low contrast. Without a clear difference between foregrounds and backgrounds, the image can seemingly lack focus. You can play with the blacks and whites to adjust the contrast in your photo. Some of the best photography editing software offers a contrast slider that can help refine your image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/photography-editing-tips-4.jpg"                      alt="adjust the image contrast"                ></p><h3 id="5-Try-Overlays"><a href="#5-Try-Overlays" class="headerlink" title="5. Try Overlays"></a>5. Try Overlays</h3><p>Layering different textures and images to your photo is a great way to create visual interest in your image. Overlays are easy and helpful tools that are present in nearly all photography editing apps. You can use these to set the mood and create your desired atmosphere in the image.</p><p>Overlays are also useful for creating double exposure effects in your image. If you want to highlight some specific part of your photo, you can do it by adding a simple overlay. You can even adjust the transparency and intensity of the overlay to reach the desired effect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/photography-editing-tips-5.jpg"                      alt="apply overlays to image"                ></p><h3 id="6-Straighten-the-Horizon"><a href="#6-Straighten-the-Horizon" class="headerlink" title="6. Straighten the Horizon"></a>6. Straighten the Horizon</h3><p>Want to create a balanced and stable look for your image? You can easily achieve that by straightening the lines in your image. Although a simple trick, it is often overlooked and can impact the overall symmetry of your image.</p><p>You can choose a baseline in your image and then adjust it to straighten the image. Setting the skew during post-processing can help you create impactful images. Usually, the horizon is used as the baseline that needs straightening. You can also choose any other line in your photo and make use of the grid to rotate your image until it is in order.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/photography-editing-tips-6.jpg"                      alt="straighten the horizon"                ></p><h3 id="7-Split-the-Tone"><a href="#7-Split-the-Tone" class="headerlink" title="7. Split the Tone"></a>7. Split the Tone</h3><p>During the photography editing process, a little split-tone can go a long way. This means you can add specific colors to the shadows and highlights of your image. You can play with these colors to make your photos fall on the warm or cold end of the spectrum. Split tone can get out of hand pretty fast, so remember to keep it subtle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/photography-editing-tips-7.jpg"                      alt="use split tone feature"                ></p><h3 id="8-Know-your-White-Balance"><a href="#8-Know-your-White-Balance" class="headerlink" title="8. Know your White Balance"></a>8. Know your White Balance</h3><p>Adjusting your image’s white balance is crucial for the photography editing process. All the light sources around you have their specific temperatures. They can thus bring a specific color temperature to the photo. Cameras are usually set at auto white balance, but you can alter that in the post-processing to satisfy your requirements.</p><p>While JPEG images can somewhat bend to a specific color temperature, RAW files offer a greater degree of flexibility. You can adjust your white balance to bring the photo towards a warmer or cooler tone. You can also create a warm&#x2F;cold contrast to bring a dramatic effect to your image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/photography-editing-tips-8.jpg"                      alt="adjust image white balance"                ></p><h3 id="9-Pay-Attention-to-Details"><a href="#9-Pay-Attention-to-Details" class="headerlink" title="9. Pay Attention to Details"></a>9. Pay Attention to Details</h3><p>Being a photographer means having to keep a close eye on the details. No matter what type of photographs you are capturing, everything from nature to headshots requires keen attention to detail. One way of doing so is to remove spots or any background clutter from your picture.</p><p>Most of the prime photography editing apps offer spot removal tools. You will often encounter images where some careful adjustments are inherent. You can remove blemishes, stains, or any other distracting element from your image. This will help bring a clean and focused look to your picture.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/photography-editing-tips-9.jpg"                      alt="remove the spots from image"                ></p><h3 id="10-Don’t-Take-It-Too-Far"><a href="#10-Don’t-Take-It-Too-Far" class="headerlink" title="10. Don’t Take It Too Far"></a>10. Don’t Take It Too Far</h3><p>It is quite easy to get carried away during photography editing. Remember not to take your editing a step too far. Try to keep the natural element of the image intact and avoid overdoing the contrast and color saturation. Heavy editing can often cause a perfectly good image to fall apart. Steer clear of unnatural editing and strong color grading.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/photography-editing-tips-10.jpg"                      alt="do natural image editing"                ></p><h2 id="Wrapping-Up"><a href="#Wrapping-Up" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping Up"></a>Wrapping Up</h2><p>The process of image editing is not always a piece of cake.
